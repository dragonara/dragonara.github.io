    <p>I have left this until last not just because it is last in the book but because for me it is the weakest link.</p>
<p>To start with Buckingham says that it is almost impossible to be a good leader and a good manager. That the two things not only rely on separate skills, but are mutually exclusive. A point of view that I completely and utterly disagree with. Whilst doing either thing well is challenging and enough to keep most people busy learning for most of their career - I don't believe that they are impossible to do at the same time.</p>
<p>Which brings me onto his advice: For Leaders he says</p>
<blockquote><p>"Determine what is universal and capitalise on it"</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't think that advice is as clear as I think it needs to be. He goes on to say that to lead one must identify with people's universal fears and help them overcome them. The main fear that he identifies as crucial for leaders to help their followers overcome is fear of the future and he offers the further advice that leaders need to provide clarity on the following questions:</p>
<p>Who do we serve?<br />
What is our core strength?<br />
What is our core score? (How do we measure our success?)<br />
What actions can we take today?</p>
<p>And I agree with that as advice for leaders, but I am not sure that those sentiments are adequately summarised as: "Determine what is universal and capitalise on it"<br />
So whilst it was a very interesting perspective, I am a long way from being able to wholeheartedly agree with all three of the 'one things'.</p>
<p>And from my perspective, leadership is much more about enabling people and motivating them than giving them answers to those questions. In my view, leaders need to help their team collaborate on the answers to those questions. And not just from a large-scale organisational perspective but for every team at every level moving through the organisation.</p>
