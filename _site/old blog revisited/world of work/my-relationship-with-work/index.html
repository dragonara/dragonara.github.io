    <p>So we've <a title="Is it OK to talk about love at work?" href="http://helenwalker.net/?p=155">already established</a> that I love work!</p>
<p>And I often think that it seems like that is serendipity, you know, the right job, the right time, but I think that it's much less straightforward than that.</p>
<p>OK, so I'm very lucky to have an utterly brilliant job and amazing colleagues, but I do think that work, like every other relationship, is one that takes care and effort. There will always be bad meetings, bad days, bad weeks even. But fundamentally <a title="Circles of influence and concern" href="http://helenwalker.net/?p=120">I am responsible</a> for how I deal with all of those challenges. And also I'm responsible for maintaining the feeling of love I have for work. If I'm grumpy (and I sometimes REALLY am) then I need to understand that and learn from it. That might mean reconsidering my perspective, cracking on to get things done, working on some different projects or even handing my notice in and looking for a fresh start.</p>
<p>And of course, if we expect most of our colleagues to invest more than just 'doing' into their work then we have to understand that there is an emotional component to that. Most of the jobs in an organisation like this one that involve making choices about how we work with people and how we respond to situations. Those choices require a kind of self management that necessitates emotions being part of the world of work. And if instead of love you feel anger, hatred or frustration, what is the likely impact on your ability to do your job well?</p>
