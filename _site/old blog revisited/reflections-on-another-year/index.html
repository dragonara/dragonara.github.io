    <p>Yesterday* was the the last session of this year's First Line Manager Leadership Programme.</p>
<p>Every year the course ends with all the participants doing a short presentation on what they've learnt and how they're using it to improve their management skills.</p>
<p>Every year I cry.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Yep, every single year... Maybe I shouldn't own up to that. I'm sure there are some people who would find that strange or a little self-indulgent. And indeed yesterday someone asked me:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Why would you cry?"</p></blockquote>
<p>And I kind of shrugged off the question because in the moment it was asked I thought the answer was obvious. But like all pointy, uncomfortable questions it made me think...</p>
<p>So here is my considered answer to that question. I guess the first thing to say is that they're not sad tears, or even happy tears come to that. It's not about feeling pleased when people like it or sad when they don't. No, it's more fundamental to me than that.</p>
<p>I think it's about connection.</p>
<p>I deliver 8 of the 9 sessions that precede the presentations and having written and refined the course over the past 7 years it feels, as a lot of my training does, like it contains part of me. It presents some of my beliefs about work, makes a call to action and challenges the participants to develop their own mental model of leadership. So when people connect to it, learn from it and value it, that's pretty amazing.</p>
<p>That feeling of having an impact is really powerful. Hence the tears.</p>
<p>I'm aware that I risk sounding ridiculously smug writing this! Like I'm crowing about my own brilliance. But actually what I know is that my courses are only useful for people when they are prepared to think, talk and do the work. I'm not performing some kind of alchemical miracle. The participants do most of the work. I spend a lot of time cheering them on, like yesterday. And they talked about that, there was a amazing sense of camaraderie; a recognition of the value that they place on learning from each others' experiences. <em>The cohort really adds value</em>.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, I think seeing people learn and grow is a massive privilege and I feel very lucky that I get to work with such amazing people who are so willing to take risks, try new things and learn new ways of doing things.</p>
<p>Finally I loved these two bits of feedback from yesterday...</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve thoroughly enjoyed it and would do it again from start to finish at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>Loved the course - it's much deeper &amp; meatier &amp; more valuable than I was prepared for.</p></blockquote>
