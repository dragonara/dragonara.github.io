    <p>Downstairs at the University, my lovely colleagues from the Wellbeing Service  are handing out cups of tea and delicious looking cake and offering to chat to our students because it's <a title="World Mental Health Day" href="http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/world-mental-health-day/world-mental-health-day-2014/" target="_blank"> World Mental Health Day</a>.  As someone who has battled with her mental health issues <a title="Living with depression" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/08/02/living-with-depression/" target="_blank">in the past</a> I really value their efforts to remove the stigma and engage in the conversation about the range of issues that I know affect so many people.</p>
<p>I remember that tight feeling I had, knowing how close I was to not being able to cope anymore and worrying about how people would perceive that and worst of feeling all the shame of not coping. I'm better now, but like everyone else I have good days and bad days. Days where I feel that life is difficult and I'd like to run away and join the circus (Ring-mistress obviously!) And, given the job I do, I also have days where I look into a colleague's eyes and see a lot of stress, sadness or frustration and have a wash of empathy.</p>
<p>Events like today remind me that my mental health is a work in progress and t<a href="http://helenwalker.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuperHelen.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-426" src="/assets/SuperHelen.jpg" alt="SuperHelen" width="262" height="262" /></a>hat taking care of myself is important. As much as I might like to pretend I am superwoman, I'm really not! Although obviously I would look cool in a cape! I try to remember to build fun and space into my life. And that the strangeness of life is part of the gig.  Being aware of the thing that keep me smiling when things are tough.</p>
<p>It also reminds me that it's important to talk about these things.  I don't especially consider myself any kind of role model, but I know that for some people being given that diagnosis feels like being awarded a failing grade and knowing that there are people who have not just survived and but continued to thrive and contribute is important.</p>
