    <p>The man who made my coffee this morning at the Coffee Kabin properly cheered me up.</p>
<p>It wasn't just a cup of coffee to him, he really cared about it. He weighed out the grounds and steamed the milk as if he wanted that coffee to be the best thing that would happen to me all day.  The great thing about the conversation this morning is that he didn't say it was the best cup of coffee in the world, just the best cup of coffee he could make.</p>
<p>It reminded me of the Martin Luthor King Jr sermon:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If it falls upon your lot to be a street sweeper, go on out and sweep streets like Michaelangelo painted pictures, sweep streets like Handel and Beethoven composed music. Sweep streets like Shakespeare wrote poetry. Sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will have to pause and say, 'Here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It's a tough challenge to be the best you can be at what you do, there are times when it  feels like an up hill struggle, too much work, not enough appreciation. Sometimes there are too many doubters and not enough support. There is too much temptation to compare our insides to other people's outsides.  Leaving us with the sense that "I'm struggling and everyone else is flourishing."</p>
<p>So ask yourself are you doing the best job you can? What would <strong>your</strong> Michelangelo/Beethoven/Shakespeare work look like?  How will you be closer to that next time, next week, next year?  Once you have that in your head, work out what you need to make that happen, what's the plan? If you can't do it on your own, find a coach, mentor or friend who can help you.</p>
<p>And the coffee? The effort definitely paid off!</p>
