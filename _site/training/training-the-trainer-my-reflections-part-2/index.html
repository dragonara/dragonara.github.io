  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>So after the training last week, I was reflecting on the<a title="Training the trainer â€“ my reflections part 1" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/08/30/training-the-trainer-my-reflections-part-1/"> things that impacted</a> on my experience.</p>
<p>I'll be the first to admit I probably knew less about the content than most of the people in the training room, but I was pretty curious. And then...</p>
<p>The premise of the course was that it was 2 days, the first with one trainer who was an "<a title="Expertise" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/08/31/expertise/">expert</a>" in the kind of thinking process that we were using to frame being a trainer and facilitator, and the second day with someone who was an "expert" trainer, and learning about the process from the trainer from day one.</p>
<p>Early on day one, the trainer for that day admitted that he hadn't really prepared before the night before. He didn't really have to tell us. Yes, it was clear that he felt comfortable with his knowledge, that he was happy to answer questions, but from the point of view of someone without his level of knowledge? It seemed to me that his ideas were not connected. And his framing of all those new ideas didn't really help me understand the whole or even the parts.</p>
<p>We spent about 4 and a half hours that day listening, the idea being that on day two we would focus on application. Phew! That was hard going. By the end of the day I felt like my brain was smeared all over the training room wall and that I knew way less than I had at 9am that morning. The three short training activities that were included in that day did not give me enough opportunity to really get to grips with the material.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the trainer on day one told us that if we tried to think about the philosophical content too much, the challenging of really getting to grips with it, would cause our egos to possibly deal with the challenge with cynicism. Urgh. Frustrating. </p>
<p>So maybe this sense of disappointment is my fragile ego and my tendency to over think? Or maybe communication doesn't just happen? Maybe you need a plan?</p>
