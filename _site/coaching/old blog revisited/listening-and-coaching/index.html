    <p>I've said it before, but really <a title="If I could do one thing betterâ€¦" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/08/12/if-i-could-do-one-thing-better-2/">listening</a> to people is one of the most challenging parts of my job. Often when I am working as a coach with colleagues my role involves listening to people explain the challenges of their role, talk about how they see the world, how they feel about what they see.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_549" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://theenthusiastictrainer.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/whycoaching.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-549" src="/assets/whycoaching.png?w=300" alt="My reflections on The Coaching Secret - Dr Andrew Machon" width="300" height="300" /></a> My reflections on what I hope to achieve when coaching others[/caption]</p>
<p>I recently reflected on what I'm trying to achieve when I coach colleagues. What I've noticed when I'm coaching is that, while each person is trying to achieve is different in the specifics, there are some commonalities in the direction they intend to travel. People are often trying to reconcile how they see themselves with how they believe they need to act at work. That might present itself in a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>wanting to do something that seems outside the "rules" of the organisation</li>
<li>a belief that they don't have the necessary character traits to carry out their role</li>
<li>feeling a lack of confidence about their skills or potential</li>
</ul>
<p>When people describe their challenges and we start to explore their underlying beliefs there is sometimes a significant gap between how they describe themselves and how I and other people might describe them.</p>
<p>Here lies the challenge for the coach. For, of course, my reality isn't any more real than theirs. I believe that understanding and listening to people is much more important than being 'right', that the greatest value in coaching comes from that sense of having someone empathise rather than judge. I can't describe how challenging it is to listen to people talk themselves down when I <a title="The people I coach (yes that means you)" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/07/27/the-people-i-coach-yes-that-means-you/">hold them in such high regard</a> and wonder whether doing that makes them less effective, less courageous, less likely to achieve.</p>
<p>So, for me the challenge when coaching people is to really hear what they have to say. Really understand it; really believe that that's how they see themselves, how they think and feel about themselves. To do that and then to trust in that process that allows them to start to see a way forward.</p>
