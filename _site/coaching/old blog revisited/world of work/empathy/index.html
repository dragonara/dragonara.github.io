    <p>There was a long conversation on our recent Coaching Skills course about the need for empathy.</p>
<p>There are different elements to empathy, <a title="Daniel Goleman's Homepage" href="http://danielgoleman.info/" target="_blank">Daniel Goleman</a> describes this in his book Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships. He says;</p>
<blockquote><p>In today's psychology the word "empathy" is used in three distinct senses: <em>knowing</em> another person's feelings; <em>feeling</em> what that person feels; and <em>responding compassionately </em>to another's distress. These three varieties of empathy seem to describe a 1-2-3 sequence: I notice you, I feel with you and so I act to help you.</p></blockquote>
<p>And I sometimes think that while empathy is one of the defining attributes of being human; feeling empathy is hard. I think it's hard because we are designed for making quick judgements, finding intellectual short cuts that allow us to quickly judge and understand a situation. In our modern world that tendency is exacerbated by the number of people we come into contact with, the speed of those interactions and the number of distractions that we deal with. Really engaging with and listening to other people takes time. Trying to understand how they see the world takes imagination and a willingness to imagine that there is more than one reality.</p>
<p>And this idea is critical, we each experience the world differently, as a result of the filters we apply and the beliefs that we have. We construct the meaning of our experiences for ourselves, deciding what is good, bad, challenging or easy. If I choose to believe that good things happen to me, then I will see good things happen. We tune ourselves into the way that we think the world is.</p>
<p>Although I think it's difficult. I also think empathy is critical in helping us build successful relationships, but as described (from 9:47) in this David Foster Wallace 2005 speech it also gives us the ability to give others the benefit of the doubt.<br />

<p>And, yes, this is important as far as our interactions with strangers, but, crikey, it's vital for our interactions with people close to us; our family, our friends and our colleagues. How often do we struggle to understand the way someone else sees the world? We are skilful at explaining the behaviours of other people with stories about what those people are like and why they act in the way that they do, but there is a significant risk that those assumptions are flawed. Worse than that there is a risk that those assumptions don't allow us to respond in the most appropriate way.</p>
<p>I notice this when I am working with others as a coach. It's great when you start to understand another person's perspective, you start to get a glimpse of how they see the world. Often though, perspective is the very thing that is causing them to be stuck. The temptation is to try to tell the person you're coaching that they're wrong, but often a more rewarding approach is to really try to understand their beliefs and then help them to see how they are linked to their experiences.</p>
