    <p>One of the things I love about my role is the opportunity to coach some of my most talented and able colleagues. Sometimes as a coach and sometimes as part of one of our development groups. The interesting thing for me is that I suspect none of them would recognise themselves in that description.</p>
<p>While this saddens me, it doesn't surprise me. Most people are suffering from some form of imposter syndrome; the feeling that at some point their incompetence may be found out. They compare the uncertainty and complexity of their internal thinking with the seeming simplicity and competence of other people's' external behaviour.</p>
<p>Steven Covey says that the following are the <a title="Steven Covey: 7 habits" href="https://www.stephencovey.com/7habits/7habits.php">Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</a><br />
Habit 1: Be Proactive<br />
Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind<br />
Habit 3: Put First Things First<br />
Habit 4: Think Win-Win<br />
Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to be Understood<br />
Habit 6: Synergize<br />
Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw</p>
<p>Looking for ways to succeed with the task at hand is a way to combine Habits 1&amp;7, so seeking out coaching is a great way to do that. My role as coach is not to tell people what to do, but rather to help them understand a situation differently so that they can decide for themselves what to do.</p>
<p>A fundamental foundation for this work is that I trust and respect the person I'm coaching. I trust that they are the best person to decide to act, to decide on that action and to evaluate how well it went. This respect and trust comes partly from my beliefs about people, but in the main it comes from understanding their world view and a sense of <a title="Empathy" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/07/27/empathy/">empathy</a> with that. And that understanding and empathy comes from listening to their perspective.<br />

What also strengthens that respect is seeing them work and grow, taking responsibility for their own learning and growth. After all I know that this is difficult, it involves change and building new habits. My job is to be challenging. The people who face those challenges with honesty and courage are my work heroes. I have nothing but admiration for them.</p>
<p>Gold stars all round!</p>
