This means when Juliet's cousin challenges Romeo to a dual, not only does Romeo not want to fight him, Mercutio thinks that Romeo is being a bit rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;

They understand that while the poor performers demand a lot of attention, they should fight to recruit talent to their teams and their project teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there are challenges to managing talent. And you need to work hard to help them use their talent in the most productive way. But too many managers fail to appoint people because they might move on in 2 years or they might be using the role as a stepping stone. To which I say, 'so what'. Put your big girl (or boy) pants and enjoy the ride.&lt;/p&gt;

They understand that while the poor performers demand a lot of attention, they should fight to recruit talent to their teams and their project teams.
Of course there are challenges to managing talent. And you need to work hard to help them use their talent in the most productive way. But too many managers fail to appoint people because they might move on in 2 years or they might be using the role as a stepping stone. To which I say, 'so what'. Put your big girl (or boy) pants and enjoy the ride.
Help them find projects that stretch them...
Help them manage the waves that they make...
Back them up...

&lt;p&gt;The main one I see is a failure to recognise our role in empowering others. When we coach them, ask them questions, trust them to solve their own problems, allow them to use their expertise we add value to our community as well as affecting change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True power comes from service, from the vulnerability of not having all the answers, from honouring the uniqueness of others and allowing them to shine. If you have to wield your power as a threat to others, then all you have is short-term power.&lt;/p&gt;
