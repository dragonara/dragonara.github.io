    <p>My abiding memory of school is not being one of the cool kids. I wasn't even cool-adjacent, I was a full-on nerd, and in the 80's there was very little of the more recently acquired geek-gloss, that might have given that a credibility of its own. I was an outlier; interested in things that most of my peers thought were dull; like science, sums, sewing and black and white movies. I wasn't ashamed of that, but I certainly didn't embrace it whole-heartedly.</p>

<i>-- Arthur Schopenhauer, philosopher</i></p></blockquote>
<p>It's only in recent years that I have truly realised the value of being a little weird, a little obsessed and, most importantly, comfortable in my niche. Not only that, I've found myself drawn more and more to other people who are clear about who they are and unapologetic for their unique perspective on the world. I like working with those people, helping them seeing how their unique contribution is making things better.</p>
<p><a title="Seth's site" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a> in his book "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1936719223" target="_blank">We are all weird</a>" talks about the weirdification of the world. <a href="http://theenthusiastictrainer.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/we-are-all-weird.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-503" src="/assets/we-are-all-weird.png?w=300" alt="We are all weird" width="300" height="140" /></a>The bell curve is spreading, we are becoming more diverse. Because the internet supports creating new things and the building of tribes around those things, there is more acceptance of the weird in the world.<br />
On Friday* night I found myself having a little impromptu post-conference drink with three colleagues and I realised that they were my cool kids. The smart, funny, lovely people I was sat with were the kind of cool I want to be now. Not just because of their smart/funny/lovely but also because each of them are doing the work that they are good at, that they believe is necessary and even though its hard they are changing things.</p>
<p>They inspire me to work harder and try new things and to trust my unique perspective. Not to be like them, but to be more like me. I might not have been part of the cool gang at school, but now I get to pick who I think is cool and to try to do the things that allow me to be part of their gang or even build a gang of my own.</p>
