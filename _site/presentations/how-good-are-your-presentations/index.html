    <p>Most of the presentations I see are OK. But it isn't very often I see a really great presentation. Which given the number of brilliant colleagues I have seems somewhat perplexing.</p>
<p>I'm not talking about nerves, because, unless you're a very experienced presenter, nerves are to be expected. I'm talking about something much more obvious and much harder to fix.</p>
<p>How often have you sat in a presentation feeling like the presenter wasn't really talking to you? As if they were talking with you in attendence rather than because they wanted to engage with you. And to me it seems that so often the presenter is so busy telling the audience what they should know that they fail to realise that they have a job to do in engaging their audience, selling an idea, gaining buy-in.</p>
<p>So my question to you is do your presentations actually achieve anything?Â  Do people go away not only with a clear idea of what they need to know, do, think or plan but also with the motivation to do it?</p>
