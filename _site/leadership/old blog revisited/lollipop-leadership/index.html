    <p>I love this TEDx talk.</p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCBrkrFrBE</p>
<p>TED has the strapline "ideas worth spreading" and for me this is one of them. We use it as part of the Presentation Masterclass to talk about presentations that create change, tell stories and have an emotional impact. I have to admit though, that's a bit of an excuse, because the main reason for using it is that I love to watch it.</p>
<p>I see these lollipop moments all the time, people doing or saying small things that have a huge impact on someone else. But the thought of telling the people who have fundamentally made my life better how they did that? I can say, without any hesitation, that scares me, I feel vulnerable about telling the amazing people I know how important, clever, special, smart, or brave I think they are. What if they don't care what I think? What if they laugh at me? What if they think I'm being insincere or just offering meaningless flannel? What if they see it as me trying to ingratiate myself with them? But I agree with him when he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>We need to redefine leadership as being about lollipop moments. How many of them we create, how many of them we acknowledge and how many of them we pay forward and how many we say thank you for. Because we've made leadership about changing the world and there is no world, there's only six billion understandings of it and if you change one person's understanding of it, one person's understanding of what they're capable of, one person's understanding of how much people care about them, one person's understanding of how powerful an agent for change they could be in this world you change the whole thing. And if we can understand leadership like that. If we can redefine leadership like that I think we can change everything.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I might not word it perfectly, sometimes people may not want to hear it, but I want people to know that I admire them, respect them and am grateful for them. And even though it makes me uncomfortable, and sometime the recipient uncomfortable too, I'm going to carry on offering my perspective to those people in the hopes that it is helpful to them.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I'm a success today because I had a friend who believed in me and I didn't have the heart to let him down.”</p>
<p>― Abraham Lincoln</p></blockquote>
