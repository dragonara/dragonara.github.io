    <p>There is a lot of talk in organisational development circles about the "cultural narratives" that describe how we see things are in organisations that we work in.</p>
<p>One of the stories that I hear people telling is that leadership and management are easy; <strong>for other people</strong>. Now, they might not always say it as boldly as that, but however subtly people express this idea that other people are much more capable.</p>
<blockquote><p>All things are difficult before they are easy - Thomas Fuller.</p></blockquote>
<p>The truth is that all the leaders I know who try to tackle difficult situations understand that those things are hard and actually there is nothing wrong with finding them hard. There are some elements of being a manager that <em>should</em> be hard; giving challenging feedback, using disciplinary procedures, dealing with a colleague after a bereavement. Finding these things "easy" would be to seriously underestimate the impact that they have on others.<br />
I think there is something liberating about acknowledging that our experience of things is meant to be difficult. It gives us the chance to struggle without feeling like we're not good enough.</p>
<p>So maybe our story should include 'being a manager is hard, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to try to do it as well as I can."</p>
