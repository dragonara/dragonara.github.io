    <p>I never realised how annoying I find the phrase "At least..." was until a recent conversation with a colleague.</p>
<p>I was talking about something that I was really upset about and the person I was talking to used it about three or four times. Each time I felt more and more frustrated, I suddenly realised that what I was hearing was "stop being so whingy it's not THAT bad".</p>
<p>Thinking about it later I realised that there might be a number of possible interpretations.</p>
<ol>
<li>They wanted to change the subject or end the conversation.</li>
<li>They thought I was over-reacting to the situation.</li>
<li>They wanted me to see that there were other ways to interpret what had happened.</li>
<li>They were feeling somewhat impotent about the situation and they wanted to say something helpful.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, any or all of those things could be true, but the point is, that in that moment I stopped feeling helped and started feeling defensive. In that moment, our rapport took a hit.</p>
<p>Why do I think that is that so important?</p>
<p>Imagine you are upset, imagine something has happened that has left you feeling sad, bewildered or angry. There are two things to do in those situations, deal with your emotions and make a plan. The two are certainly connected but I believe that you need to start to deal with your emotions before you can make a plan because in order to make a plan you need to do your best thinking, and I don't know about you but I do my best thinking when I am feeling calm, resourceful and supported.</p>
<p>So from on, as a coach, I'm going to be aware that some phrases are possibly going to move the person I'm working with away from that mindset.</p>
