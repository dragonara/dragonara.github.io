    <p>I seem to be talking a lot about the value of feedback at the moment. How important it is for managers to give their teams good feedback, how important it is for teams to give their managers good feedback. And how important it is for everyone to give everyone more feedback... And I can feel the blah, blah, blah pouring off my fingers as I type. I am unsure whether I need to say it, so loudly and so often... But then so many of my colleagues seem unable to answer some very basic questions about their performance?</p>
<p>Are you doing OK? How can you tell?<br />
What do you do really well?<br />
What are your special skills? Are they appreciated?<br />
Where do you need to improve?<br />
What are the priorities for your development? Why?</p>
<p>I think everyone from the best performer to the worst needs to get feedback - not just from their managers, but from their team, their peers, their "customers" (in whatever form that takes).<br />
But it's hard and giving feedback comes with risks:</p>
<ol>
<li>The risk of being unfair, or subjective.</li>
<li>The risk of being ignored.</li>
<li>The risk of being misinterpreted.</li>
<li>The risk that giving someone some feedback will change your relationship with them.</li>
</ol>
<p>These risks are magnified by the proximity of your working relationship (the closer you work with someone the riskier it feels), the difference in hierarchical position, and how much you like and respect someone (either extreme, feels riskier than the middle).<br />
The acronym SNIP (sometimes SNAP or similar) can help...</p>
<p>S - Specific; talk about a specific situation rather than "you always..."<br />
N - Neutral; talk about behaviour rather than assigning judgements to personality characteristics, "you sounded distracted and like you didn't want to have to deal with the customer" rather than "you were rude".<br />
I - Impact; talk about the impact of the behaviour. This helps the feedback seem less subjective.<br />
P - Prompt; give feedback as close to the occasion as possible, the same day or week is better than waiting for the "right moment". The only exception to that is if you need <strong>some</strong> cooling off time because of the nature of the situation.</p>
<p>And for me the last thing to remember is to plan your feedback, off the cuff feedback is rarely as coherent and helpful as feedback that is considered and drafted</p>
