    <p>When I was thinking about today's word it struck me how old-fashioned it sounded. I was trying to think of the people I consider to be honourable, and came up a little short. As in one name, maybe two.</p>
<p>Thinking further, I realise that the idea of 'honour' <a title="Comparison of word usage" href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=honour%2C+integrity%2C+authenticity&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2015&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Chonour%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bhonour%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BHonour%3B%2Cc0%3B.t4%3B%2Cintegrity%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bintegrity%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BIntegrity%3B%2Cc0%3B.t4%3B%2Cauthenticity%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bauthenticity%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BAuthenticity%3B%2Cc0" target="_blank">seems to have been o</a>vertaken by ideas like 'integrity'. Which begs the question 'does that matter?'</p>
<p>Language has a strange power, sometimes the subtleties of language add to that power. You can use quite similar words interchangably and then realise that they have different key meanings.</p>
<p>An obvious example I often talk about is Leadership vs Management. Is being a manager different from being a leader? Should it be? They certainly sound like different things, but critically our expectation is that leaders manage things and managers lead people. But, like it or not, when we call people a 'leader' that is different from calling them a 'supervisor'.</p>
<p>So is there a key difference between integrity and honour? I wonder if the difference is about external vs internal congruence. Is it that integrity is about that sense of internal congruence; "You can trust I will do what I say I will do, not just what is easy" and that's a great thing.  Maybe honour is about that <strong>plus</strong> a sense that you are also signed up to a larger code of behaviour, be that professional, moral, ethical or spiritual?</p>
<p>My sense of the word honour elevates that integrity to something more than the singular of self to the plural of a community, whichever community or communities we choose to belong to.</p>
