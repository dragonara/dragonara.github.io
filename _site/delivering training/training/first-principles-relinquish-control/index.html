  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It has been said that<a href="http://helenwalker.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ripples.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-471" src="/assets/ripples.jpg" alt="ripples" width="448" height="252" /></a> I'm something of a control freak, and there may be some truth in that. When I started as a trainer I wasn't good at going with the flow.</p>
<p>I have always felt a lot of responsibility for the experience of my participants and I want to make sure that they get the most out of the training and development events I deliver. This impulse makes me want to do as much as I can to make sure that they're learning and getting the most value from the session.</p>
<p>The trouble is that that intention runs counter to my belief that learning is about taking responsibility for deciding what you want to know and how you want to change. That as a learner you need to identify the opportunity for improvement, find the motivation for doing something different and then work out what that different thing is. If I'm your trainer, facilitator or coach I can't do any of those things for you. All I can do is give you the opportunity to work those things out as we go. Support you when you need it, challenge you to shift your thinking.</p>
<p>For me this has been the most difficult challenge to overcome. Giving over control to the participants.  Allowing them to chose what they take from the session, letting them try things and make their own decisions.</p>
<p>So, how do I give up this control? Group work is a perfect example, as a trainer I can spend a lot of time after each group discussion, carrying out feedback and making sure the group talks about all the things on my list of "things that are important", but endless group activities followed by feedback is kind of dull. And as the trainer you run the risk of playing the "can you guess what answer I'm looking for" game.</p>
<p>I also try to keep the participants' needs ahead of my own agenda, making sure that I am not so enamoured of my own ideas of what the content should be that I fail to cover the the content that will answer their questions. It can be more useful to tailor the content to the participants than to cover my favourite ideas.</p>
<p>Of course all this demands that I am know what the participants on my courses are trying to achieve.  But that is the subject of another post.</p>
<p>****This is another in a series of blog posts reflecting on my principals of training design, the posts include <a title="First principles – part 1" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/09/23/first-principles-part-1/" target="_blank">respect participant knowledge</a>, <a title="First principles – part 2" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/10/07/first-principles-part-2/" target="_blank">the power of the group</a> and <a title="First principles – Why Participants Should Participate" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/10/09/first-principles-part-3/" target="_blank">why participants should participate</a>.</p>
