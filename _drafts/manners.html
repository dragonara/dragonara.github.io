<p>When I was a little girl I was drilled in the importance of manners, I was adept at the 'pleases' and 'thank yous' that my Mum drilled me in, managing the daily 'please may I leave the table' with aplomb and the necessary 'Thank-you-for-inviting-me-I-had-a-lovely-time' when required. Manner then seemed like a habit, delivered in the sing-song voice of routine, rather than a genuine expression of anything.</p>
<p>Now I'm (a little) older, manners are a whole different thing. Manners are theÂ  grease in our social wheels, the way we help other people feel more at ease. When we are polite to people we are giving them the acknowlegement of their efforts and their existence. They say, "I see you" or "we're all the same" "I respect you".</p>
<p>But recently I have noticed that there are more and more situations where manners are not yet clearly defined. Social media for one, that person on Twitter who not only misunderstands your tweet but is then quite abrasive in response or the person on Facebook who mocks your well-meaning Auntie who responds to everything with supportive kindness.</p>
<p>And mobile technology is also a minefield. I have certainly used my phone when it should have been put away,</p>
