<p>Ok, no, not really...</p>
<p>But there is something rather smug-inducing about seeing your name in print even if it is on page 4 of the Staff Developers Newsletter!</p>
<p>I don't know whether it is a cultural thing, but often boasting about success seems a little unnatural, or big-headed. My Mum always says that "no-one likes a show-off!" But whilst that might be good advice for a precocious eight-year old, I am not sure it continues to hold 30 years later.</p>
<p>If we need to be credible with our colleagues, to be able to celebrate our successes and those of the institution, then we should be able to speak about the things that are going well. If we are to feel valued and if the organisation is to be recognised as the innovative and progressive institution it is then we need to feel that we have something special and unique to offer.</p>
