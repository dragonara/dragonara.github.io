<p>On the recommendation of someone I admire, I started to read The Michael Neill's book <a href="http://insideoutrevolution.com/excerpts/#.Uap05dLOuuI">Inside Out Revolution</a>: The only thing you need to know to change your life forever."<br />
I've struggled with it.  Not because I don't agree with the content but because it's truly challenging stuff, and it pushes me outside of my intellectual comfort zone.</p>
<blockquote><p>The simple truth is this: Our experience of life is created from the inside out...  We're living in the feeling of our thinking not the feeling of the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote><p>...frustration isn't feedback about our life but feedback about the quality of our thinking at any particular moment.</p></blockquote>
