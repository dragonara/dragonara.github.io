<p>Given how much time we spend communicating we should really be better at it. Whilst there are lots of routes to improving how well we share our ideas with others, one of the key reasons is that we know too much. In their excellent book, Made to Stick, <a title="The heath brothers" href="http://heathbrothers.com/" target="_blank">Chip and Dan Heath</a> explain:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it. Our knowledge has “cursed” us. And it becomes difficult for us to share our knowledge with others, because we can’t readily re-create our listeners’ state of mind.</p></blockquote>
<p>When you understand something you have already built the links between that idea and your understanding of the world. Remembering what is was like to not understand it is very hard. But that is what we need to try and do in order to explain to those who don't understand it. There are some simple strategies to help with that process.<br />
Challenge your assumptions about what our listener might or might not already understand.<br />
Try taking a step back and asking yourself why</p>
