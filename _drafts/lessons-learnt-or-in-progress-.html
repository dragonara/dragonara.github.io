<p> I think some lessons are harder to learn than others.  Some behaviours and beliefs are so deeply embedded that even once we know (intellectually) that we need to change them actually doing that takes a huge amount of focus and energy.  In my <a title="Living with depression" href="http://theenthusiastictrainer.wordpress.com/2013/05/17/living-with-depression/">recent post</a> I wrote about my struggles with depression.  I think that taught me some incredibly valuable lessons.  But of course learning is a process.  And there are times when I realise that my new learning is <strong>much</strong> less embedded than those old behaviours.<br />
A model that I find helpful to use to talk to others about their learning is the conscious competence model.  This model explains how learning takes place in a number of stages.<br />

<ol>
<li>Unconscious Incompetence, the learner doesn't know what they don't know.  They might be unaware of what they need to know or even that there is anything to know.</li>
<li>Conscious Incompetence, the learner becomes aware of how much they don't know. I think this can be a very demotivating part of the process as this is the point at which the learner realises how much they might need to learn.</li>
<li>Conscious competence, the learner starts to understand how to do better, but they have to plan and think about it as they do it.</li>
<li>Unconscious competence, the learner becomes less aware of what they are doing as they start to perform the task without having to think about it.  It becomes part of their skill set.</li>
</ol>
<p>I find thinking about learning in this way is really helpful, as it allows me to reflect on where I am </p>
