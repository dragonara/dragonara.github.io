<p>Sometimes I hear stories about managers in the organisation than make me *facepalm*. The kind of things that make me think "Noooooooooooooooo"</p>
<p>This is my list of things that I think are kind of obvious, but still seem to fall off people's radars.</p>
<ol>
<li>Talk to people. No, really</li>
<li>Don't try and manage by stealth</li>
<li>Be nice</li>
<li>Don't be perfect</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
