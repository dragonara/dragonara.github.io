<p>There I was, sitting in the hairdresser's chair, drinking tea, reading <a title="Anneli Rufus" href="http://www.annelirufus.com/unworthy.html" target="_blank">my book </a>and waiting for her to mix the next batch of colour for my hair.</p>

<p>"What are you reading?" she asked, no doubt thinking it was the latest murder-by-the-numbers or perhaps a chick-lit masterpiece. I showed her the cover...  "Oh, that sounds cheery" she said, laughing nervously. Then, after a pause, "maybe I should read that".</p>
<p>The book is called Unworthy: How to stop hating yourself and the author Anneli Rufus describes what it is like to deal with the sure and certain knowledge that you are somehow less than everyone else, the sense of worthlessness and all the implications that it has for your day to day life.</p>
<p>Of course, I could write this blog post pretending that this is one of those books I read to get a better perspective on the issues that other people bring to the table...  But honestly that wouldn't be true. So while it does sound a bit overly dramatic to say that I hate myself; I would be lying if I said I didn't. Let's just say that my sense of self-worth has to be propped up by a tortuous and elaborate system of daily bargains.  I doubt many people would think that I have any reason to feel that way. So having this conversation with people tends to end up with them trying to persuade me that I'm irrational. Like I don't know that!</p>
<p>The book was a much funnier and more charming read than you would imagine from the title. Rufus describes the devastating inevitability of certain experiences creating a sense of unworthiness</p>
<p>The most valuable solace this book offered is the understanding that I'm not alone, that being here is almost logical given my life and the lessons I learnt along the way.  It's an intersting balance to demonstrate that there is a sense of logic to it whilst still holding onto to the idea that it isn't true or fair. After all, just because you think it, doesn't make it so.</p>
