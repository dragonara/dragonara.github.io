<p>So this afternoon I'm listening to a presentation. Not that unusual. Even though I see a lot of presentations, normally I'm watching to give feedback. Today I'm watching because I want to learn something.</p>
<p>And if I'm honest I'm struggling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not because of the content. But because of the style of the presenter. The metaphors, the stories and the structure aren't really resonating with me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how would I improve this session?</p>
<ol>
<li>Work on your confidence. Sometimes the easiest way to do this is to focus on your audience and their interest in your content rather than their yourself. Be aware of your language, inflection and posture.</li>
<li>Think carefully about your stories and metaphors. I know that it might have seemed like a great example when you were planning your presentation but remember <b>the curse of knowledge</b>.</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
