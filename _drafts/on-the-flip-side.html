<p>On the flip side of my <a title="Lollipop leadership" href="http://theenthusiastictrainer.wordpress.com/2013/06/26/lollipop-leadership/">earlier post</a> about the importance of giving thanks for other people's care and brilliance, it seemed important to reflect on receiving other people's feedback.<br />
I'm in the very fortunate position of getting lots of feedback from people. But some of it is really hard to take, and I struggle to accept what people are saying. As with a lot of the people I work with the problem is not accepting critical feedback but hearing the positives.<br />
Even typing this I want to bat myself round the back of the head. I mean basically I've just announced that people say nice things about me, I mean, really, how much do I love myself?</p>
