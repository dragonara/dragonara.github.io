<p>This week I had one of those days... A day that really forces me to challenge my beliefs about people.</p>
<p>Part of this job is to work with colleagues on team builds and away days, and, as usual, most people are professional pleasant and fun to work with.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>On the other hand, sometimes it seems that being a staff developer is about being willing to make people miserable; to bring out their cynicism and their frustration. So, as much as I want to believe that individual people are making the best choices they can in any given moment with the resources that they have to hand, there are some days that those beliefs are really challenged. As most teams seem to contain at least 1 person) who think that what we do in Staff Development is either entirely worthless or designed purposefully to make them miserable.</p>
<p>I think away days are perceived as an opportunity for managers to waste their staff's time by taking them away from their desk and distracting them with pointless work-related activity or even worse with pointless 'fun'. It is fascinating that these work related activities are usually the manager's attempt at engaging staff in meaningful conversations about how the work is organised or how they relate to their colleagues or other stakeholders. Sometime that intent is badly communicated, sometimes perceptions are coloured by experience, sometimes the urgent work really is important as well as urgent.</p>
<p>Whilst I can empathise with the frustrations, I really believe it is incredibly valuable to focus on the important rather than the merely urgent. As <a href="https://www.stephencovey.com/blog/">Covey </a>suggests with his <a href="http://www.orgcoach.net/timematrix.html">time management matrix</a>, taking a step back is a crucial part of how we succeed as an organisation, as teams and as individuals. It is very easy to spend a huge amount of time focussing on the work that is urgent allows us to feel we have achieved. We concentrate on the busy work, looking busy to look busy or because it offers us a way to protect ourselves from the risk of failure, of trying and failing; wasting the time and the energy. <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/06/fear-of-shipping.html">Seth Godin </a>talks about this fear of shipping in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Linchpin-Indispensable-Career-Create-Remarkable/dp/0749953357/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1277114188&amp;sr=8-1">Linchpin</a>, shipping is how he describes producing work that has impact, the right work at the right time... And the fear of delivering something that you feel is important is powerful. We think "what if no-one agrees", "what if it doesn't work", "what if I'm wrong" and worst of all... "What if it works and I change the world". This is why I think that away days are an excellent opportunity to focus on the vital parts of the organisation, refocus on the purpose and try to figure out what is the scary idea that could change the way we do things.</p>
<p>That idea could be small, or it could be huge, but it will be crucial to have it. Some ideas come from periods of quiet reflection and individual thought and work, others come from the opportunity to listen to others and work as a team.</p>
<p>So what do I need to do? Do I have to challenge myself to be better and believe better about the people I work with? To deal better with my frustration that other people don't 'get' it? I think I do. To accept that people are where they are and that I can influence a little part of that, but the majority of it is their own fears, doubts and insecurities. And to be more confident in my own rationale for the work I do, which despite the appearance of happy-go-lucky it is utterly purposeful.</p>
