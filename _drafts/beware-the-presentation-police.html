<p>People hate it when I turn up in the audience at their presentations. Not because I heckle, or because they just don't like me (at least I hope not) but the groans and jokes are probably more related to the amount of training I've delivered on presentations, the books I've read and the (supportive and challenging) feedback I've given.</p>
<p>OK - I have some strong opinions about <a title="Presentation Catagory" href="http://helenwalker.net/category/world-of-work/presentations-cat/">presentations</a>. On how they should look, on how they should be structured, on how people should present. And if you ask me I'll tell you how I think you could make your presentation better.</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned it is way too easy to write a mediocre presentation to open up PowerPoint and start typing as if somehow the order that information flows out of your fingertip ends is the right way to present it to the audience.</p>
<p>Generally we present what we think people should know, in the way we think they should get it.</p>
