<p>I've loved watching the <a title="My Shakespeare" href="http://www.sky.com/tv/show/my-shakespeare/article/about" target="_blank">Sky Arts series My Shakespeare</a>.Â The series has explored the humanity, language and history of each play from the perspective of actors, directors and academics.</p>
