<p>I'm the staff development manager in a UK University. Although I do think that Empress of Staff Development is a much better job title!</p>
<p>At work I'm a training whirling dervish with a passion for using felt-tip pens and sticky notes, I love working with my many, many talented colleagues, helping them do big scary stuff and be more brilliant at work. My role is part cheerleader, part agony aunt, part annoying know-it-all. What I hope is that I make it more interesting and fun to work at the University and I try and remind people to be kind to be each other.</p>
<p>I work in a small team so it’s no surprise that my work interests are wide ranging, they centre on leadership, creativity, communication skills, presentations, coaching, trainer development and all things geekery.</p>
<p>I'm obsessed with learning new things, and some of the content of this website will be me trying to consolidate my learning, reflect on ideas and generally chew things over.</p>
<p>And I'm an unrepentant poly-geek. My geek passions include going to see productions of Shakespeare plays at the RSC, old films with Cary Grant &amp; Jimmy Stewart, maths and physics, Star Trek &amp; Doctor Who, needle, thread, paper, scissors &amp; glue…</p>
