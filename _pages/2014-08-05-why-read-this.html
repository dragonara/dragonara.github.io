<p><strong>Having a love affair at work</strong></p>
<p>I love my job. I think that everyone deserves to have a job that they are happy to get out of bed for in the morning; a job that fulfils them and that they can perform brilliantly in.</p>
<p>As a staff developer my role is to help people get a job they love, by being confident, courageous, influential, and by ensuring that they are doing brilliant and fun work.</p>
<p><strong> Why am I a woman on a mission?</strong></p>
<p>Growing up, both my parents worked at jobs they hated. My career has been about spiralling in on the perfect job for me - and I've had jobs that made me miserable, so fundamentally I think this an important battle. I also think that it doesn't take much to be the kind of person who makes other people's working lives easier and more fun. And I don't mean by bringing cake to work every day - I mean by improving the quality of what you do and the way that you do it. Whether that's the way you listen to others, the way you present information to people or the way you build connections. By being intentional, courageous and congruent; understanding that work can be a great source of satisfaction or a great source of anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Why is it so blinkin' difficult?</strong></p>
<p>The working world has changed, we are expected to be much more skilful in a much wider range of things, and we have to juggle the vast amount of stuff on our plate as well as the new things we are expected to take on and this leaves us with the pressure to just get things done.</p>
<p>In this way mediocrity is easy; in fact being good is easy.  Being kick-ass-awesome is difficult, because it needs you to find a way to super-charge your learning, to take risks and really do things that are scary and may make other people do the "face". You know, the face that says "who do you think you are?" and "well that'll never work". And do you know what? I doubt that's even what they're thinking, but we are scared by our power and by our own audacity.</p>

<p>So if you are curious about what I am talking about here, here and here are some posts to get you started. Feel free to comment and to get in touch.</p>
<p><strong>Why should you read any of this?</strong></p>
<p>Fundamentally I am just like you, wracked with self-doubt, unsure that I have any insight to offer and scared that people are going to roll their eyes and shut this tab before clicking on a single link. But on the other hand I have a head full of ideas that could give you a fresh perspective and I have read masses of stuff that I can share with you.</p>
<p>More than just the massive volume of other people's ideas in my head I also have 2 secret weapons...  Firstly my ability to explain things and secondly my experience of having</p>
