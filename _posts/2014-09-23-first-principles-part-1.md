<p>My background is science, some people think that that is unusual for a staff developer who is obsessed with pens, post-it notes and the kind of 'fluffy', feeling stuff that I do. And they well be right.</p>
<p><a href="http://helenwalker.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/penssmall.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-500" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/penssmall.jpg" alt="penssmall" width="421" height="315" /></a>On the other hand thatÂ background does give me a desire to distill things down, to understand and make my working principles visible.</p>
<p>So this (I hope) is the first in a series of blog posts exploring some of those principles, explaining why I think they are important and describing some of the ways I apply them. So to get the ball rolling, I'm going to start with this:</p>
<h2>Respect participant knowledge</h2>
<p>One of the things that I do at the start of a session when working with groups or individuals is get them to tell me how much they know. Not as a test (urgh), but as a way of acknowledging and understanding some of their perspective, context and existing knowledge.</p>
<p>Especially working in this kind of place with highly educated, expert colleagues there is often a slight sense of discomfort around training, and that can be exacerbated when participant's feel that the trainer isn't really aware of the challenges that they are facing or how they want to apply the knowledge and skills that they are there to acquire. I want the participants on my training sessions to feel respected, valued and safe to learn.</p>
<p>How do I do that? Obviously it depends on the kind of event, group size and the content. Sometimes I set up a series of questions on flip chart sheets round the room and get people to wander round and answer the questions, sometimes I set up some group discussions either for small groups or the whole group.</p>
<p>Another way of doing this is to get them to ask questions, or describe what it is they want to get out of the session. That usually gives me an idea of their existing understandings and some of the underlying beliefs that we might need to work with before we can move on.</p>
<p>The thing that I like about this approach is that I can then present my content appropriately, addressing specific concerns and challenges. I believe this makes learning and change much more likely.</p>
