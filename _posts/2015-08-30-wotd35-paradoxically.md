<p>If something seems paradoxical, surely that's a sign that our understanding hasn't caught up with reality. Finding something that seems altogether both true and contradictoryÂ is a sign that we don't understand the situation. But that's a good thing, as physicist, Niels Bohr said:</p>
<blockquote><p>How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our brains love to unpick the uncertainty, and so finding something we don't understand can help us to move to a new level of understanding.</p>
