<p>When I was teaching, we talked about the joy of a lightbulb moment, that point where a kind has the kind of 'a-ha' realisation that changes the nature of their understanding.</p>
<p>It's a very attractive idea, that someone can be inspired, visited by the muse, or inspired by us as teachers to have an epiphany.</p>
<p>Now I'm certain that those moments come from the hard work, that they only happen when we've laid the foundations, done the preparation, slogged our guts out for the work.</p>
<p>Shame!</p>
