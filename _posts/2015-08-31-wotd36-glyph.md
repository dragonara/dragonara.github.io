<p>Maybe it's the mathematician in me, but I think that when it comes to communicating we're far to reliant on words.</p>
<p>Using symbols and diagrams is hard work, they need us to work hard to turn our ideas into something simpler than sentences.  And for the inexperienced the hard work is invisible, the path to clarity is obscured by the idea that everyone else has a magic talent that makes it easy. That invisible hard work allows us to be clearer, more persuasive. It helps us get from a surface understanding of the idea to a richer one. As Einstein said:</p>
<blockquote><p>"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."</p></blockquote>
<p>And that understanding comes from playing with the ideas, working with them, solidifying them. When I started this project I thought that the quote on the post-it note would trigger the blog post. And actually it's the other way round. Writing 200 meaningful words is easier than writing 20.</p>
<p>Writing this blog is the hard graft. Drafting and redrafting allows the ideas to become simple.  Maybe occasionally simple enough for <a title="WotD23 – Area" href="http://helenwalker.net/2015/08/18/wotd23-area/" target="_blank">symbols</a>.</p>
