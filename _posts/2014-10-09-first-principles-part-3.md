<p>When I'm planning a training session one of the things that underpins my planning is the idea that for the participants <strong>doing is better than listening</strong>.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong -<a href="http://helenwalker.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bluemorningsky.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-486" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bluemorningsky.jpg" alt="bluemorningsky" width="448" height="252" /></a> I love to talk. A LOT, and I have lots of things in my head that I want to share with the groups that I work with, stuff that they will find helpful, things that they will be able to apply, but that's not really the point.</p>
<p>I was recently on a two-day training programme where I spent 75% of the first day sat listening. It was excruciating. The content was challenging, the trainer was charismatic, I was attentive but that didn't really help. I was being asked to absorb, with little time to reflect or engage with what I was listening to. To make matters worse we were sitting in a horseshoe of chairs so I couldn't even doodle or make notes comfortably.</p>
<p>So I did a quick calculation...</p>
<p>150 wpm x 60 min x 6 hours of listening = <strong>54,000 words</strong></p>
<p>That's about 200 pages of a paperback, and that's a lot of words. The scary thing is when I think of how many I remember it's probably about 50 and if you asked me to summarise the content, probably the sum of everything I could say would be about 1000 words.</p>
<p>And the trouble is when you are a training participant you know that. When you are writing a training program you forget. You think "I'll just run through these 56 slides, it's all really important and they need to know it all."  And that's when I hear <a title="Danger" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwOJlOI1nU" target="_blank">this</a>...</p>
<p>Getting people to participate is really important to their learning. (Probably one of the reasons I call the people who come to my training courses participants instead of trainees or learners.  And for those of you who are familiar with the idea of <a title="Wikipedia - Honey and Mumford" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles#Peter_Honey_and_Alan_Mumford.27s_model" target="_blank">learning styles</a>, I'm not only talking about activities for activists, I'm talking about anything that lets the people in the room play with the ideas you are presenting and make them their own.</p>
<p>****This is another in a series of blog posts reflecting on my principals of training design, the first was <a title="First principles – part 1" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/09/23/first-principles-part-1/" target="_blank">respect participant knowledge</a>, the next <a title="First principles – part 2" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/10/07/first-principles-part-2/" target="_blank">the power of the group</a>.</p>
