<p>Recently* I read "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/One-Thing-You-Need-Know/dp/1416502963/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1281279148&amp;sr=1-5">The one thing you need to know</a>" by Marcus Buckingham. Not that it is just one thing; it offers one criterion for success for leaders, one for managers and one for 'sustained individual success'.</p>
<p>For sustained individual success, Buckingham advises</p>
<blockquote><p>"Discover what you don't like doing and stop doing it."</p></blockquote>
<p>This is more powerful, he says, than simply trying to spend time doing things that you like, by focusing on our preferences as much as our abilities he believes that we can free ourselves from some of the grinding, frustrating things we do because we 'have' to.</p>
<p>I think that he is right, many times people get trapped into a kind of masochistic belief that there are parts of their role they must carry out and can't deligate or renegotiate. Whilst there might be a small percentage of things that are not negiotiable, I think often challenging ourselves to get rid of tasks that bore, frustrate or annoy us is a good first step to finding more satisfaction at work.</p>
<p>So the question is, what do you dislike doing? Can it be done in a different way? Can someone else do it? Does it need to be done at all?</p>
