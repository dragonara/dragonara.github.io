<p>There's a voice in my head and sometimes that voice is vicious.</p>
<p>There's a voice in my head and sometimes that voice is destructive.</p>
<p>There's a voice in my head and sometimes that voice is defensive.</p>
<p>The choice I can make is to recognise that that voice is neither helpful or truthful. Just because I have a thought it doesn't make it the truth.</p>
<p>I am a human being, a master story-teller, I am skilled at building narratives that explain my place in the world. But those things are confabulations, they are constructs, sometimes true, but often a nonsense.</p>
<p>So, my story-telly brain has a voice, it says, "I am not good enough", "I am useless", "I am unlikeable". And those things are not the truth, for anyone.</p>
<p>The voice in your head may beÂ trying to protect you - but it doesn't really understand how to.</p>
