<p>There is something really dangerous about the current fad for positivity.</p>
<p>Yes, it's important to practice good mental health habits, like expressing gratitude and focusing on the positives. But <a title="Scientific American: Negative Emotions are Key to Well-being" href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/negative-emotions-key-well-being/" target="_blank">negative emotions exist for a reason</a>, they allow us to monitor our boundaries and our relationships. They provide us with useful data. They allow us to navigate the pitfalls and challenges that life inevitably throws our way. Pushing away, ignoring or even distracting yourself from negative feelings doesn't help us in the long term, even if in the short-term it feels better.</p>
<p>The challenge when we're experiencing those negative feelings is to find the middle ground between dwelling in the negativity and ignoring it.</p>
<p>The  challenge when the people we care about are experiencing negative feelings is to allow them to express them, process them and move on. Even when that is uncomfortable. Especially when we want to fix them and their feelings.</p>
