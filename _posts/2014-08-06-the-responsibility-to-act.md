<p>In my coaching work with colleagues, they often talk to me about their frustration with particular work situations. When they talk about areas that aren't working as well as they should, they wonder if it's OK to try to do something different to deal with the situation, if tackling an issue is part of their job, or why other colleagues don't do something instead of them.</p>
<p>That's a difficult set of questions to answer. In general I think the responsibility to act comes down to two things, the first is perspective and the second is the ability to affect change. If you believe that something needs to change and you feel that you can in some way influence that, then yes, I think you are the right person to do something. And most people will accept that they have the perspective to see the change and motivation to do something about it (otherwise we wouldn't be talking about it) but feeling like they can influence others? To help make things different? That sometimes seems out of reach.</p>
<blockquote><p>The price of greatness is responsibility.</p>
<p>--Winston Churchill</p></blockquote>
<p>There is this idea that the right person to act is further up the organisational hierarchy, has more power, more influence. Or if not more influence, then more skill, more intelligence, more of that elusive something that makes sorting the problem out more straight forward. The trouble is that often the people who have the most ability to affect change are the ones who try. That doesn't depend on job title or pay grade. They don't wait for permission to roll their sleeves up and get on with it, they just focus on doing what they think needs to be done, starting small if necessary and being willing to experiment to get the results they want.<br />
Of course I don't necessarily think that you should know what needs to be done, after all if it were obvious or easy you'd probably already be doing it. And that's where having a coach or a mentor can work; helping you analyse a situation and design a path to try. The important thing is making the choice to act, the choice to take responsibility.</p>
