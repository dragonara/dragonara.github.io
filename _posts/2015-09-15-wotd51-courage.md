<p>As I've written before, I love Brene Brown's definition of <a title="Daring Greatly" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/07/28/daring-greatly/">courage</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Courage, the original definition of courage,when it first came into the English language --it's from the Latin word cor, meaning heart --and the original definition was <strong>to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart</strong>."</p></blockquote>
<p>Now we think of courage as overcoming our fears, dealing with the challenges in front of us to do what's scary and doing the important work that we need to do for ourselves and we believe is needed by our community. While that seems simple enough, it's really not. Partly because our fear feels like it's protecting us from, real life-threatening dangers like sabre-tooth tigers. When you're afraid of that difficult conversation with a colleague, a presentation in front of senior staff or going for a job interview, your brain reacts as if your life is in danger.</p>
<p>The other challenge is that it's hard to see when other people are being courageous, we see their brave outsides but we can't see their fear. We need to tell tales of our struggles so that others can see how truly courageous we are and how far we have come.</p>
