<p>I've seen a real emphasis over the last few years on the importance of design.Â  Whether you're talking about technology like tablets and phones or home-wares the idea of beautifully designed objects has become part of our experience.</p>
<p>But the thing is that design or the lack of it is everywhere, when I buy way too many books on Amazon it's because the sneaky blighters have made it way too easy by re-designing their ordering process. If I spend money on an iPad instead of a cheaper tablet, it's because of the way it feels in my hands rather than the technical spec.</p>
<p>But design is not limited to websites and techy toys, what about the design of a meeting, a presentation, a conversation, a training course? Which, of course, is how I spend my time. Organising my thoughts, structuring my ideas, getting buy in, communicating clearly are all part of great design.</p>
<p>All well and good, but where does the <a title="Empathy" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/07/27/empathy/">empathy </a>come in? Great design needs to come from the perspective of understanding the user, the participant. And that's not that hard, we've all been on the receiving end of training courses, presentations &amp; conversations. Some good, some not so good.</p>
<p>To design these things better we need to reflect on being a consumer; what is that experience like? What did the leader/trainer/facilitator do? How did that make it better or worse? So that when the time comes to make a plan, what we actually do is design an experience.</p>
