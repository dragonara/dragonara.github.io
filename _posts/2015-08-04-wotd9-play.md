<p>I agree with Wayne (I know!!  don't tell him, it'll only go to his head), play is essential for everyone, not just children. Maybe our natural reluctance to consider play a useful way to spend our time is partly the result of the way that our school system taught us about work.  If we learn from school that play is something that little kids do and doesn't have a purpose for older kids, that they're taught to search for the right answer and get lots of ticks, then the result might be that we think play is fine for kids, but we think as adults our job is to find the right answer as quickly and efficiently as possible. The problem with that approach is it encourages us to be risk-averse, afraid of failure and to spend much less time thinking and learning than just getting on with it. As adults play is really important, not just the kind of play that Wayne talks about, although obviously that's a good way to practise. For me the joy of the idea of play is the way that brilliant people use play at work, to use work 'rules' in the same way that games use rules to constrain and stimulate problem solving and learning. </p>

<p>Play is a way to explore the world and to understand it better. To try new things and to experiment. To understand that all the really interesting questions and problems don't have 'right' answers; they generate rich and complex solutions that challenge our thinking and make us create new exciting outcomes.</p>

<p>P.S. Obviously if I'd have started with this word I might have been tempted to use a more theatrical meaning of the word 'play'. All day the quote from Hamlet has been bouncing round my head:</p>
<blockquote><p>More relative than this—the play's the thing<br />
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.</p></blockquote>
<p>And I had a whole stream of thought about that, that I will have to save for later :)</p>
