<p>Sometimes when I am listening to a person talk it seems like idea vomit. Is that grim? Ha, probably!</p>
<p>But when the ideas come out in such a jumble, not just a stream of consciousness, but as a backwards and forwards, inside and outside, ziggy-zaggy arrangement of ideas.</p>
<p>The trouble is that communicating clearly is deceptively easy. We look at the people who can do it without extraneous information, verbal tics and missing key pieces of information and we see the finished article rather than the work that goes into to hone it.</p>
