<p>Limerence is the state of being infatuated, the delightful feeling that we can't live without someone or something.</p>
<p>Infatuation is short-lived. Biologically it exists as a stepping stone to something more long-lived, the dopamine high, wears off and we are left with a choice. Love for work, love for an idea, love for a person, they all require us to make a choice, to take action, to take care of our relationship with the thing.</p>
<p>Of course, modern story-telling rejoices in the infatuation phase, there are a million stories and songs about the act of falling in love and being saved by it. There is very little celebrating the act of choosing to love someone day after day, even when that's difficult...</p>
<p>After all finding a way to carry on expressing out love is the ultimate act of creativity.</p>
