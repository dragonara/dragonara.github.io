<p>Last week I was at one of the biannual <a title="SDF Conference" href="http://sdf.ac.uk/events/857/sdf-november-conference-creative-leadership-how-we-develop-our-leaders-with-originality-and-impact.html" target="_blank">SDF conferences</a>, over 2 days there were 4 key notes, 4 workshops, and 2 other plenary sessions.<a href="http://helenwalker.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/0.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-529" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/0.jpg" alt="The Met Hotel Leeds" width="321" height="321" /></a> And while there was some interesting content (and some less interesting content) the thing that I find challenging about those kind of events is the lack of opportunities to really engage with the content.</p>
<p>I'm not talking about networking. Over 6 coffee breaks, 2 lunches and a conference dinner I found plenty of chances to talk to my amazing and brilliant colleagues. What I'm talking about is having the opportunity to reflect on the ideas presented and work out how I want to apply them to my everyday practise.</p>
<p>The standard conference format is a way of squeezing masses of content into a short period of time. Which is both a strength and a weakness. Yes on the positive side, you get lots of ideas and lots of ideas interacting with each other and you can move from session to session cherry picking ideas. On the other hand, you lose a lot of the material in moving form room to room, very little time to think about how to take the material or the skills and practise their application. And when the conference is Thursday and Friday? Well I'm not sure how much of that material stays in your brain to be applied back in the workplace the following week.</p>
<p>Even more ironically the conference theme was creative leadership and if you believe (as I do) that creativity is a skill and a process, then it's one we should have the chance to explore and practice.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Creative thinking - in terms of idea creativity - is not a mystical talent. It is a skill that can be practised and nurtured." Edward de Bono</p></blockquote>
<p>So, how would I have changed things? Workshops that are actually workshops and not more presentations. And space after the plenaries to work on ideas in groups. Facilitated discussion around themes that we think are of interest. Using <a href="http://www.openspaceworld.org/" target="_blank">Open Space Technology</a> maybe?  I want to be able to do some thinking and thinking needs space.</p>
<p>Luckily some colleagues and I made a plan to get together in few months to work on our own ideas and see if we can challenge ourselves to do things differently and take a few risks. I'm excited to see how that turns out.</p>
