<p>I know, I know,  you've missed me!  I wish I had a great excuse, but the truth is, It's way too easy to not write things.  There's lots of reasons why, but before I get to that...  Why not sort it out?</p>
<p>So here's the plan: My smashing, smart friend and I have come up with a scheme to reboot and refocus our blogging...</p>
<p>One year of words: That's 366 (what with next year being a leap year and all) inspiring us to post here and on his website (waynehanley.com) starting today. We've come up with a list of words and we're going to take it in turns.</p>
<p>Either he's going to use the word to inspire a great doodle (because that's one of his super powers) and then I am going to use that doodle to inspire me to write something pithy and wise on a post-it note or I'm going to use the word to inspire me to write something (or quote something) and he is going to use that to inspire his doodle.  Sounds simple?</p>
<p>I hope, so, who knows if we can make it past week one, nevermind up to 366 posts. But there's fun to be had. And that sounds like a grand scheme.</p>
<p>As well as on our websites you can find our posts on <a title="Helen's Twitter feed" href="https://twitter.com/Helen_SDU_Hud" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a title="My Instagram Feed" href="https://instagram.com/h313n1w/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> (We're using #PositivePostIts)</p>
<p>Feel free to join the fun! This week our words are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Monday: Alarm</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Tuesday: Happy</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Wednesday: Strength</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Thursday: Virtue</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Friday: Team</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Saturday: First</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Sunday: Logical</li>
</ul>
<p>And here is the song my post might have you humming.</p>
