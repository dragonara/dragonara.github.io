<p>Genius is one of those words that means a whole range of different things to different people. A high level of intelligence in one particular field, an ability to change the nature of an area of study.</p>
<p>For me I think the most interesting part of the idea of genius is the ability to create. After all we all have the ability to create, we do it every day. Form words into new sentences, find new solutions to old problems</p>
<p>To create is human, but doubting our ability to create things of value is also human and as far as I can see the answer is <a title="WotD51 – Courage" href="http://helenwalker.net/2015/09/15/wotd51-courage/">courage</a> and <a title="WotD15 – Methodology" href="http://helenwalker.net/2015/08/12/wotd15-methodology/">love of the process</a>. We might think that our perspective is too different to be valuable, but in fact uniqueness is the only thing we have. The trouble is that we take that for granted, and this constant struggle between conformity and individuality can pull us away from celebrating our own perspective.</p>
