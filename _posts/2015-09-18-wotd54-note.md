<p>My love of post-it notes is a really badly kept secret. And something of a running joke!  But there are a few reasons that I use them so much and I love them.</p>
<p>Firstly they when it comes to working with groups they are great for capturing ideas in any idea generating process. Not just because you have to contain your ideas within a 76mm x 76 mm square; helping people to keep their ideas concise. But also it makes it easy to sort, prioritise or combine those ideas later on.</p>
<p>The other reason is that having ideas on pieces of paper that everyone can see is a good way to make sure that communication is simplified and when you work with a group that's really important. The act of agreeing how things should be sorted or prioritised is more concrete when everyone can see what's happening.</p>
