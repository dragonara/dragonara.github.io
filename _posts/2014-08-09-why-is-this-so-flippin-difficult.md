<p>I'm not writing as much as I want. I realise that I'm getting in my own way a bit. Gandalf keeps telling to "just get on with it" which is sage advice. (No surprise there) but I keep allowing myself to get sidetracked, distracted and, honestly, a little scared.</p>
<p>Really I know there's not much to be scared of. It's not life or death; it's just a website. My usual perfectionist response to the fear is kicking in, despite the fact I know I'm never going to write the perfect post or page. And that the reason I am doing this is, at least partly about practice and "finding my voice" (yep, I just cringed at that) </p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure how to shift this inertia, but I don't really think my internal exasperation is going to do it. I think I need to stop writing new thoughts down and start writing down what I already know. Perhaps answers to the kinds of questions I get asked a lot. </p>
<p>The good stuff will come. Eventually. For now, I need to be a mediocrity machine.</p>
