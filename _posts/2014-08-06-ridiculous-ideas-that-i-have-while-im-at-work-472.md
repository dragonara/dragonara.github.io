<p>There are so many print options - can I add one more?</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be great your printers could have a series of pre-recorded comments that they could play as they printed things for you:</p>
<p>"oooops" for when you have to reprint a page because you found the typo in the title.</p>
<p>"Hurray" for when you print the final version of something you've worked on for ages.</p>
<p>or perhaps a short fanfare or an exclamation of "that's the most interesting document I've printed all year!" Or maybe something a lot less polite when you have to print off something pointless!</p>
