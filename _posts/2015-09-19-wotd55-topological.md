<p>I am fascinated by the shape of ideas, the way that a diagram can explain an idea more succinctly than words.</p>
<p>The process of trying to sketch an idea as a diagram actually helps me to deepen my understanding of an idea, forcing me to be clear about what it is I am trying to say. After all the more you understand a topic the more obvious the idea seems to be. Sketching my idea also helps me overcome this <a title="WotD49 – Incoherent" href="http://helenwalker.net/2015/09/13/wotd49-incoherent/">'curse of knowledge'</a> so I can explain it to someone else. Clarifying the relationships between the parts of the idea; cause, effect, hierarchy, peer.</p>
<p>Of course as G.E.P. Box the statistician wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful."</p></blockquote>
<p>The same can be said for diagrams, they don't fully explain your ideas, but they provide a bridge to them, they allow it to be communicated more clearly. Choosing to use them sometimes is a way to help other people see the world the way you want them to.</p>
