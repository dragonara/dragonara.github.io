<p>So far there seems to have been some definite stages to this website project...</p>
<p><strong>Initial excitement</strong> - yay! There's going to be a website. I'm going to do loads of exciting things. Who cares if people think it's nonsense or not!</p>
<p><strong>Planning phase 1</strong> - Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm</p>
<p>(yep I got a bit stuck. Luckily two very wise people gave me a little nudge, nudge 1 was "have fun, play, enjoy the process". Nudge 2 was along the lines of "what have you done?")</p>
<p><strong>Planning phase 2</strong> - Just do some planning stuff and see what happens. Excellent fun - wheeeee!</p>
<p><strong>Planning phase 3</strong> - But, what if, but, what if, but, what if, but, what if, but, what if,  but...</p>
<p>Yep, stuck again, more wheel-spinning and over thinking...</p>
<p><strong>Moving content from the old blog here</strong> - I've written stuff already - some of it's not bad, just needs a bit of a freshen up. Apparently it "<a title="Finding my voice" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/07/25/finding-my-voice/">doesn't sound that much like me</a>" But tinker, tinker - rewrite etc...</p>
<p><strong>Publish it woman!</strong> - <a title="Why is this so flippin’ difficult?" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/08/09/why-is-this-so-flippin-difficult/">Yep, got a bit stuck again</a>. This time in a world with 30 draft blog posts and an inability to publish. Gandalf to the rescue...</p>
<p><strong>Putting stuff out there</strong> - Published some material and wrote some new things...  Asked some nice people for some feedback - got nice feedback. So I have a website, but only people who I've asked to look at it are looking at it...</p>
<p><strong>Started sharing</strong> - Courage comes in the form of positive feedback. So now to social media... Twitter etc...  And do you know what people are reading it! Not hundreds, but some and this is kind of fun again!</p>
<p><strong>Habit forming </strong> - started adding to <a title="My ideas need a home" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/07/15/my-ideas-need-a-home/">my book</a> of ideas and also writing a few sentances on a new blog post when I have an idea. But now I have 27 blog ideas that need to be written! Oh crikey :)</p>
