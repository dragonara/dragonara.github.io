<p>Well today's word is a corker. <a href="http://waynehanley.com/blog/2015/08/08/doodle-a-day-day-13/">Wayne's powerful blog post</a> describes how fear can wipe out all rational thought and leave us looking for answers.</p>

<p>Of course fear and its symptoms are an evolutionary gift. That sick feeling, the lack of rational thought, the laser focus that comes with it? They are all ways to survive the threats that our ancestors experienced, like being attacked by a wild animal. Of course in 2015 our fears are more subtle and our survival strategies offer little in the way of help.</p>
<p>While our experience of fear is viscerally real, the meaning we give the emotion is the thing that gives it power. Trying to squish it, ignore it or berate yourself for feeling it isn't likely to help.Â </p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><script src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js" async="" defer="defer"></script>I don't have any magic solutions, of course. What I find helps is sharing our story with someone who will allow us to acknowledge the feeling at the same time as challenging it's basis in reality. And who can sit with us while we make a plan of baby steps.</span></p>
<p>Fear is not to be avoided, after all it tells us what we believe is important or who we think we should be. What we should try to avoid is judging ourselves or others for being afraid. The fear is real even if the fear isn't reality.</p>
