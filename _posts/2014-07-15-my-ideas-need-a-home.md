<p>I've never read a creativity book that doesn't include advice about keeping a notebook for your ideas.  And ironically, though I love notebooks and own a number of spanky-cool ones, they are rarely used for anything, mainly because of the force of my counter-creativity perfectionism.</p>

<p>When I started working on this website it seemed like it was time to face that demon, so here it is...</p>
<p>And whilst I'm not ready to share it's contents, let me tell you, it's a beautiful Paperblanks notebook with thick paper, magnetic closure and a pocket at the back for keeping goodies in.</p>
<p>OK - that's probably a bit too much stationery geekery for most people, but doing this reminded me of two key things that I find helpful when I'm attempting creative adventures.</p>
<p>The first is to find some pleasure in the tasks, and for me there is something about resources that are tactile and beautiful that is one route to that sense of enjoying the task.</p>
<p>And the second? Well I think it runs counter to the first. It's easy when faced with a pretty book with lots of blank pages to freeze in my tracks.  Will I spoil it if I write the 'wrong' thing? What if I make a spelling mistake? What if I don't make the insides match the outsides?  And of course part of the fundamental characteristics of creativity is risk-taking and experimentation.  So I have given myself permission to do it wrong and I'm staying well away from writing in pencil!</p>
<p>Let's see how that turns out!</p>
