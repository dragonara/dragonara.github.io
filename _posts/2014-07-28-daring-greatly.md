<p>Part of the reason I love my job so much is the opportunity to share interesting ideas with my colleagues. I see that the right idea, shared at the right time, with a person curious as to how to improve their working life, can make a huge difference.</p>
<p>Recently I have been reading a book that has so influenced how I think about myself and my relationships with other people that, if I won the lottery next week, I would go out to buy it for everyone I care about. <a title="Brene Brown Home" href="http://www.brenebrown.com/">Bren√© Brown's</a> book Daring Greatly is not her first book, but I think it is the one that most persuasively talks about the power of shame to get in the way of our ability to connect to others and the necessity for opening ourselves up to be vulnerable and to living whole-heartedly.<br />

<p>I first came across her work when I watched her TEDx Houston talk. I won't lie. I sat at my desk in the office with tears in my eyes as I recognised not only my own experiences, but the experiences of my friends, my colleagues and the people I love. I think it speaks to the times <a title="The people I coach (yes that means you)" href="http://theenthusiastictrainer.wordpress.com/2013/06/20/the-people-i-coach-yes-that-means-you/">I </a><a title="The people I coach (yes that means you)" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/07/27/the-people-i-coach-yes-that-means-you/">have sat</a> listening to people who I respect, admire, and value talking about themselves as if they are fatally flawed. I sometimes see that flicker behind the eyes when it feels like they are weighing up the choice to tell me something and risk being "found out". And I hold my breath hoping that I've earned their trust so that they might say that thing - whatever it is - out loud. So hearing Brown talk her research really touched me.</p>
<p>Dr Brown is a social work researcher whose work on vulnerability, courage, shame and worthiness. In her talk she says:</p>
<blockquote><p>"And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection: Is there something about me that, if other people know it or see it, that I won't be worthy of connection? The things I can tell you about it: it's universal; we all have it. The only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection. No one wants to talk about it, and the less you talk about it the more you have it. What underpinned this shame, this "I'm not good enough," -- which we all know that feeling: "I'm not blank enough. I'm not thin enough, rich enough, beautiful enough, smart enough, promoted enough." The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability, this idea of, in order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen, really seen."</p></blockquote>
<p>She contrasts this with the idea of whole-hearted living, and one of the underpinning characteristics of that is a sense of courage.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Courage, the original definition of courage,when it first came into the English language --it's from the Latin word cor, meaning heart --and the original definition was <strong>to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart</strong>. And so these folks had, very simply, the courage to be imperfect. They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others, because, as it turns out, we can't practice compassion with other people if we can't treat ourselves kindly."</p></blockquote>
<p>The courage to be authentic and to be seen by others is remarkable. If we all have a sense of shame then there is something breathtaking about revealing some of that to other people. And we use the word authentic a great deal without really pausing to consider the implications of it. If we are going to ask people to be "authentic" as leaders, as teachers and as colleagues then we need to think about how we recognise and value that resulting vulnerability.</p>
