<p>Strategy is a big old word. And it's a massively overused word.</p>
<p>It's great to have a plan, a big picture plan that takes you were you want to be. It's great to think in strategic terms, connecting ideas and seeing how complexity impacts on the day-to-day detail.</p>
<p>But use the word wisely, use it sparingly. Because credibility doesn't depend on the number of impressive sounding words we use, it depends on the quality of our listening, our decision making, our day-to-day actions. And whilst we make great decisions by thinking strategically, we need people to carry out our decisions and people are influenced by the combination of the rational and the emotionalÂ and big words don't elicit an emotional response.</p>
