<p>Well of course it makes sense that <a title="Wayne - Lycanthrope" href="http://waynehanley.com/blog/2015/08/28/doodle-a-day-33/" target="_blank">Wayne has a lot to say about being a werewolf</a>. And has the perfect image to go with his musings.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><script src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js" async="" defer="defer"></script>I have always found my own company the easiest. I like people, I like people a lot, but I find the pressure of people sometimes overwhelming. People sometimes want you to be different to feel differently, to respond in a different way, and </span><strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">phew</strong><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">, that's hard.</span> The blessing of getting older is that you start to accept yourself and accept that you're not going to get through life without ruffling a few egos and bruising a few feathers.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><script src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js" async="" defer="defer"></script>Like Wayne I have things about myself that I don't share, but it's not because I feel I'm a monster, but because I'm human, I make mistakes and my insides are squidgy-soft, you have to earn the trust. And earn the right to my vulnerability.</span> My professional challenge is that to do my job I have to share. The impervious trainer/coach/professional friend is a cold beast. Sharing the right thing at the right time in the right way? Well that's a work in progress. I try to give people a little and see how they react. Peel off the layers one-by-one. And the people I cherish are the ones who can avoid advice, allow me to be where I am and help me get out of my own thinking messes without judging me for being there. That's not much to ask is it?</p>
