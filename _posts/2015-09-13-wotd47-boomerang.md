<p>There are some lessons that we face over and over, there are times that it feels like we're being tortured by some higher power, until we learn the lessons that keep returning to us.</p>
<p>Because of who we are, we come back to the same lessons over and over again. Not because we are flawed or because the 'Universe' has some perverse need to torture us, but becauseÂ there are some lessons we all face. That are inherently part of what it means to be human, lessons about setting boundaries, managing our expectations, living with grief and not being driven by our needy egos.</p>
<p>Some we don't notice because we have the tools to overcome them. Maybe a lesson we learnt as a child, maybe there's something in our personality which means that we can overcome some of these big lessons unconsciously.</p>
<p>The ones that we are forced to repeat are the ones that we have to learn strategies for and 'luckily' there are always plenty of opportunities because the lessons keep coming.</p>
