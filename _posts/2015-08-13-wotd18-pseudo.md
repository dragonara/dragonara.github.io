<p>I wasn't looking forward to this word, but now it's here I'm feeling inspired.</p>
<p>This word to me evokes the idea of a facade or mask, something that people use to hide their 'real' selves when interacting with others. Now of course, "fake it, til you make it" is a often touted piece of advice and actually when done consciously and purposefully, I think it's useful to borrow skills and behaviours until we feel they have really become our own.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I often think that most facades being used at work are of an altogether different kind. The kind that comes from not feeling that being genuine is appropriate at work.</p>
<p>I often speak to people struggling with how to do their job and be themselves, they live in the idea that they are not enough, that someone else doing their job would be doing it better or more easily. And so they try to become a hollow version of themselves, using the facade as protection from failure and judgement.Â  They are not trying to be themselves better, they are trying to be less themselves and more neutral.</p>
<p>As my favourite Brene Brown writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Authenticity is the daily practice of letting go of who we think we're supposed to be and embracing who we are."</p></blockquote>
<p>For me this practice starts with the awareness that there are some situations and some people that allow you to be more fully yourself. Cherish those times, and those people and try get a little more of that. And then be aware when you are moved away and how far away from that centre point you are.</p>
<p>You can then start to replace your facade with something else:</p>
