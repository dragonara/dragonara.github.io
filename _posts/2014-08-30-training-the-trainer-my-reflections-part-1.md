<p>I don't often get to go on training courses, so this week was interesting. Reflecting on it afterwards I realised that some small things had made a big difference to my experience.</p>
<p>The first thing that struck me as I stepped into the room on day 1 was the seating arrangement.</p>
<p><a href="http://helenwalker.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bench2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-492" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bench2.jpg" alt="bench2" width="460" height="345" /></a> The room was laid out with three curved rows of chairs, about 30 in total. If I'm honest, my heart sank.</p>
<p>This, theatre-style layout, is probably one I use least often. It's not conducive to the audience interacting with each other, and sets up an expert-audience dynamic that doesn't help enable learning.</p>
<p>The other thing I dislike about this layout is the lack of tables. How do I fully engage with my learning process if I have to take notes in a book balanced on my knee? As a trainer would I really want my participants to be focused on juggling their cup of tea, pens &amp; paper rather than on the content we're discussing?</p>
<p>Day 2 was a different layout. This time a large horseshoe of chairs which gives more sense of it being an interactive session where I would be encouraged to talk to the other participants, hurray! On the other hand, still no tables (chunter, chunter), this time with the added bonus of feeling very exposed and with the seats too close together.</p>
<p>Of course, room layout is limited by room size and the number of participants, there might be good reason for a less than ideal layout. But in this case? It wasn't a good first (or second) impression.</p>
