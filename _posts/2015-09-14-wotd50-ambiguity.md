<p>There's something delicious about ambiguity, the realm of all that is possible.</p>
<p>Ha! The trouble is that our brains hate unfinished business of not knowing, they itch to solve the problem, know the answer, to feel sure that we can make the right decision, make the best job of planning our lives.</p>
<p>The trouble is that often there is no right decision, just you making a decision and then making the best of wherever that decision takes you.</p>
<p>After all, in the end, control of our lives is mainly an illusion.</p>
