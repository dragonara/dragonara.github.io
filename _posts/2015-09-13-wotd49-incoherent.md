<p>If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then incoherence is in the ears of the listener.</p>
<p>Incoherence is not really related to the the perception of the speaker, it's perfectly possible to be convinced that you are making great sense and to be incoherent to some or all of your audience.</p>
<p>One of my favourite quotes about this is from the Heath Brothers' book, <a title="the Heath Brothers" href="http://heathbrothers.com/books/made-to-stick/" target="_blank">Made to Stick</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it. Our knowledge has “cursed” us. And it becomes difficult for us to share our knowledge with others, because we can’t readily re-create our listeners’ state of mind.</p></blockquote>
<p>And so it is that it is perfectly possible to really understand a subject brilliantly well and still struggle to explain it to an audience. Because what it comes down to is <a title="Empathy" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/07/27/empathy/" target="_blank">empathy</a>. The ability to understand how to help others understand not just the individual modules of our ideas but how they come together to make the whole.</p>
<p>And that starts with really considering the building blocks of the ideas you are trying to explain. If all you do is empty your brain on the page or the PowerPoint then you risk being incoherent.</p>
