<p>My last post suggested some critical questions that presenters need to consider to write and deliver a great presentation. So maybe now it's time to talk about PowerPoint, and how it can add to, or indeed detract from, your presentation's impact.</p>
<p>One of the most common things I see is the bullet pointed list. <img class="alignright wp-image-438" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/lencioni.jpg?w=300" alt="Lencioni" width="265" height="199" />Here's an (old) example of one of my slides.</p>
<p>If we ignore for the moment the dated slide template (if you can, it's very 2003). My main problem with the layout of information on this slide is the lack of context and explanation that the bullet pointed list provides.</p>
<p>This might be a list where the ideas are not connected in any way, but what is more likely is that there is a relationship here that the slide doesn't help us understand. And if we place ourselves <a title="Design = empathy" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/08/10/design-empathy/">in the shoes of that audience</a> we realise that they are busy trying to understand the individual ideas <strong>AND</strong> also how they connect together.</p>
<p>Sometimes sitting in a presentation is like facing one of those tennis training machines (that are apparently called 'Lobsters') ideas are randomly fired at you and because there is no predictable pattern, no logical connection, you run backwards and forwards trying to deal with the individual ideas rather than having the time to connect them i<a href="http://theenthusiastictrainer.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/lencioni-2.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-437" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/lencioni-2.jpg?w=300" alt="Lencioni 2" width="276" height="207" /></a>nto a coherent whole.</p>
<p>I am always appreciative when the presenter gives me the framework of their argument, the shape of their ideas and then goes on to explain the detail of that. That's why I have been redeveloping my PowerPoint slides over the last few years to help my audiences connect the ideas I'm presenting. You can see (right and below) a couple of variants of the same information, Here the information is supplemented with a physical shape that helps explain the idea. The information is the same but the relationship is much clearer.</p>
<p>I think that if I present the ideas so that the audience putting less effort into connecting them they will, instead, develop a deeper understanding of the ideas. Foc<img class="alignright  wp-image-292" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Lencioni3.jpg" alt="Lencioni3" width="238" height="179" />using on connecting the idea I'm giving them to their own.  This means that they are more likely to connect them to the world outside the presentation and actually put the ideas into practice. And that, after all, is what I want them to do.</p>
