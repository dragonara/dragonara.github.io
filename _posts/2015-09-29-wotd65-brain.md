<p>Our brains are a remarkable things, each one is utterly unique, they start that way when we get our lump of grey matter and then we redesign it with by living through our experiences and practicing our skills.</p>
<p>Our brains are amazing, <a title="WotD39 – Cthulhu" href="http://helenwalker.net/2015/09/03/wotd39-cthulhu/">and flawed</a>. But for all our unique qualities and attributes there are some things that we all have in common, things that make us human. We all need to be part of a community, to experience the <a title="Empathy" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/07/27/empathy/" target="_blank">empathy</a> of others. We need to be seen, valued, acknowledged.</p>
<p>All of us sometimes fall into the trap of thinking those areas of commonality are much larger than they are, that our values, our beliefs or our thinking patterns are the same. We talk to people and imagine that they see the world the same as us, that we understand ideas in the same way. We have conversations convinced that we've talked about the same thing, but in reality the words we were using meant different things or the intentions that we thought were the same were entirely different.</p>

<p>Exploring what we share with others is a good start. Understanding the ways in which we are the same and the ways in which we are different is the start of empathy.</p>
