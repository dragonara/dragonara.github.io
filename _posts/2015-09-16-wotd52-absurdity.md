<p>Today was a good day, things went well.</p>
<p>But the absurdity is that I spent the day with the voice in my head picking holes in me and my work. Seemingly on days like this it doesn't matter what I do, it doesn't matter what I create or who I help. the voice is there, relentless, and wearisome.</p>
<p>And the worse thing about the voice is it gets in my way, encourages me to misinterpret the actions of others, has me distracted and filled with self-doubt. Â It tries to scare me away from doing the stuff that matters. Trying to persuade me that my contribution is not of any value.</p>
<p>Of course, ironically, this is me <a title="Living with depression" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/08/02/living-with-depression/">better</a>, and in the past that voice would have gone unnoticed and unchallenged. And that would have laid me low. Now I know the voice isn't real and that thinking a thing doesn't make it so, does that make happy any easier? I wish! But it's a work in progress. I am getting there.</p>
<p>There is no quick fix, even if I really, really wish there was. And I know I am not alone in this.</p>
