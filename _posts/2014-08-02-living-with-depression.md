<p>This week is <a title="Mental Health Awareness Week" href="http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/our-work/mentalhealthawarenessweek/" target="_blank">Mental Health Awareness Week</a>. I've been aware of lots of other people sharing their experiences of living with mental health problems and while I sometimes in my work talk about my own history of mental health problems, I have never written about how those experiences have shaped me.</p>
<p>I was diagnosed with Clinical Depression in 1994, I was 21 and in the last year of my degree. I suffered with the illness for about 15 years and, and, while I currently consider myself to be "well", there is always the sneaky voice in the back of my head reminding me that it might not be a permanent state. After all, in the 15 or so years when I was ill, I had long periods of "normality" between significantly debilitating periods of depression. Times when I was suicidal, or incapable of leaving the house or cried for days on end.</p>
<p>Part of the reason the illness is so poisonous is it skews your perspective; your internal picture of the world is so dangerously different from any ideas of reality. I thought I was worthless, that the world would be a much better place without me in it and if I could have found a way to remove myself from it without leaving a nasty mess I'm certain I would have done it. My world was completely joyless, I couldn't listen to music, read a book or do any number of things that I had previously enjoyed.<br />
What made it harder for other people was the fact that normally I'm pretty cheery so the change was hard for people to understand, especially as I couldn't really explain myself why I felt so awful. Like a lot of other sufferers, I struggled with the shame of the disease. One friend said "I just don't know what you have to be depressed about" and on the surface she was right, I hadn't suffered a major bereavement or a terrible childhood trauma. I have a good life. So what was wrong with me?</p>
<p>Deep down though, my depression was about a powerful sense that in some way I was flawed. Not only did I have this significant sense of worthlessness, but also a certainty that deep inside me was a dark lump of stuff that made me rotten. That's not really a conversation I could really have with people, partly because of the shame and partly because I was scared they would see through to my rotten core. The trouble is that the fear of that stopped me getting the support that I needed.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now and I know that not only am I better but that I've earned my health. Getting well took a really long time, a lot of hard work and is still a day-to-day challenge to try not to slip back into old thought patterns. I was lucky, I found an amazing therapist who I could work with and who offered me more compassion that I could manage myself. I have friends who really like the person I became. Not all of my relationships survived, and that's sad. But I think in the final balance I see it as a gift. An opportunity to learn about myself and about other people. A chance to be happy.</p>
