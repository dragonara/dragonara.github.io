<p>...it would be to listen.</p>
<blockquote><p>Buddhist Monk and Zen Master, Thich Nhat Hanh says "The most precious gift we can offer anyone is our attention."</p></blockquote>
<p>Really listening to someone is incredibly powerful.  The trouble is it rarely happens. There are lots of reasons for that, but mainly I think its because we're so busy and because it's so difficult.  We take it for granted, doing it distractedly and without really reflecting on how we can be of most help to people.</p>
<p>My work often requires me to listen to people.  Whether I am coaching or training people or just participating in meetings, what I notice is that I am involved in the richest, most productive conversations when I am really engaged with what other people say. But that's not easy; it requires me to concentrate on both their words and the meaning they are trying to convey. Doing it well makes me a better staff developer, colleague and friend, but it's something that I find very hard.  And I don't think I'm alone in that.</p>
<p>I have learnt that my responses when listening to someone else demonstrate how good my listening is.</p>
<p>- Listening isn't waiting for an opportunity to provide solutions or suggestions.</p>
<p>- Listening isn't developing or offering a judgement on the other person.</p>
<p>- Listening isn't trying to imagine what you would do in that situation.</p>
<p>- Listening isn't planning what you are going to say next.</p>
<p>No wonder it's so blinking difficult! I might not always get it right, but I don't think perfection is an attainable target, I just hope to continue to hone my skills.</p>
