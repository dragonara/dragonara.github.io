<p><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"><script src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js" async="" defer="defer"></script>So much of who we are is our choices, what we do when we're angry, what we do when we're scared, what we do when we feel overwhelmed. </span></p>
<p>After the moment has passed I sometimes wish I had done something different, especially when my resources are low and I don't feel like I have made the most helpful choice.</p>
<p>The question I ask myself and the question I ask others when they are struggling is did you do the best you could in the moment? And if the answer is "Yes, but..." then they or I can work out what response would be more satisfying in hindsight.</p>
