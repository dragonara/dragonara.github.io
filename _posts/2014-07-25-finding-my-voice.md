<p>It's a good news -  bad news kind of situation.</p>
<p>On one hand I've written stuff - yay! Well done me! On the other hand, I showed it to Gandalf and he said "it's not you yet, you sound more fun &amp; less formal than this".  Dammit!  As much as I hate to admit it, of course, he's right. (Not that I'm going to tell him that!)</p>
<p>But part of the reason I'm doing this is to find my voice. And isn't that ironic - a woman who talks for a living, but feels that she can't write.  So now I have to find a way to translate all the skills I have in organising my thoughts and communicating them out loud into my writing.  And as well as writing stuff that makes sense I also have to find a way to make it sound like me - which apparently is not the formal stuffy voice of my first attempts!</p>
<p>Of course it would help if I knew what I sounded like, but scarily, I don't. It's not something I focus on. I trust my brain to generate the right words, I focus on my intention rather than the way I construct sentences.</p>
<p>So here's my plan...  I am going to record myself for some screencast-type videos.  And (I'm shuddering as I type this) I'm going to listen to myself! Eww. And I'm going to revisit some of my old posts from my old blog and play with my writing style.</p>
<p>Allons-y!</p>
