<p>One of the ways I think that great managers are different is that they're not afraid of talent. They understand that while the poor performers demand a lot of attention, they should fight to recruit talent to their teams and their project teams.</p>
<p>Of course there are challenges to managing talent. And you need to work hard to help them use their talent in the most productive way. But too many managers fail to appoint people because they might move on in 2 years or they might be using the role as a stepping stone. To which I say, 'so what'. Put your big girl (or boy) pants and enjoy the ride.</p>
