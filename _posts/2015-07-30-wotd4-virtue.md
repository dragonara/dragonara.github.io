<p>So it's day 4, which means it's my turn to try and inspire my good friend to draw something interesting with some words.</p>
<p>And our prompt word today is "virtue"!</p>

<p>There are lots of virtues I could have picked. So why this and not something else? Well I have a bit of a fascination with the notion of <a title="Lollipop leadership" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/08/01/lollipop-leadership/">gratitude</a>. Let's face it, it's way too easy to find things to be unhappy about, so I think making an effort to look for the good enables you to find it, even when it seems quite difficult. And expressing our appreciation of others is a good habit to get into.</p>
<p>And there is a bit of our brain, the <a title="What is RAS" href="http://psychologydictionary.org/reticular-activating-system-ras/" target="_blank">Reticular Activation System</a>Â (RAS), which is believed to decide what you should pay attention to. So why not practise making it focus on the positive stuff. Make it a habit.</p>
<p>Our brains are good at that, like when you buy a new car and suddenly see lots of that make and model on the road, or if you learn a new word and suddenly see it 14 times over the next few days. Seeing the good is a habit. And one worth practising.</p>
<p>Go find someone and appreciate the heck out of them :)</p>
