<p>I'm not sure I believe in evil, I certainly don't believe that people are badly intentioned.</p>
<p>On the other hand I do believe that people carry round with them masses of hurt and insecurity. That those hurts and insecurities are often the source of their poor choices and challenging behaviours.</p>
<p>Not sure that there are anyÂ easy answers, but maybe that's the start of wisdom.</p>
