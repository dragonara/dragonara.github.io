<p>Have been playing with Instagram of late. As with all new social media experiments, I enjoy learning about what makes it tick and playing with the boundaries between posting things because I think people will respond to them and because they please me.</p>
<p>In some ways I really rather enjoy the artful nonchalance of it, but I also see it as artifice. But then all social media is about presenting selected facets of ourselves.</p>
<p>I am a great advocate of being intentional in the way you choose to use these technologies, but have to play with them to understand the rules and their languages.</p>
<p>I know who I am on Twitter. I wonder how long it will take me to work that out in this new arena?</p>
