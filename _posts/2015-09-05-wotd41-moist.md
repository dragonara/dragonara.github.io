<p>I don't know about you, but I am kind of obsessed with the <a title="The Bake Off's Website" href="http://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/" target="_blank">Great British Bake Off</a>. Â Partly it's because of the comedy stylings of Mel and Sue, but mainly it's the joy of baking.</p>
<p>In order to make a delicious, moist cake worth salivating over, you have to master the science of baking, you have to get the measurements, process and temperatures right in order to make it work. But if it was merely science I suspect it would be a lot less interesting. There is an art to it, an art beyond the prettification of the show-stopper round. An art to creating new and interesting ideas.</p>
<p>This blend of art and science that makes things interesting. You can learn the theory of anything, but it gets really interesting when you make creative decisions about the application.</p>
