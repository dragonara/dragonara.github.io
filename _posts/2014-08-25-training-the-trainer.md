<p>Tomorrow I'm embarking on a 2-day training course: the He'art of Facilitation. </p>
<p>I'm excited and also a little nervous...  I find it very odd to be on the receiving end of training. I'm so used to being the one at the front, not to mention I'm not very good at being quiet for any length of time. </p>
<p>I'm hoping to be engaged and inspired, both by the content and by the style of delivery.</p>
