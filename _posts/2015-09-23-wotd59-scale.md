<p>Sometimes there are economies of scale. Pieces of work that you can automate, so that doing it 100 times doesn't take much longer than doing it 10 times. Using technology means it's as easy to send an e-mail to 1000 people as it is to send an email to one person.</p>
<p>For me that raises two questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Just because we can do something, does that mean we should? When people see a long list of names at the top of the e-mail they are more likely to think that someone else will respond. And if they are not sure what to do with the information inside they are likely to consign it to the pile of other things someone wants them to 'know'. 2015 is drowning people in information with no help with <a title="WotD45 – Curate" href="http://helenwalker.net/2015/09/09/wotd45-curate/">curation</a>.</li>
<li>When is the hunt for economies of scale unhelpful? I think there are times when connecting with people is more important.</li>
</ol>
