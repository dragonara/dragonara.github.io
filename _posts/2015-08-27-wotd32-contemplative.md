<p>Shakespeare wrote the archetypal over-thinking hero, Hamlet, over 400 years ago .</p>
<p>Hamlet spends most of the play thinking and worrying about his existence, action and inaction. And the trouble with all that rumination is that we often get stuck in our own limiting beliefs and patterns of behaviour.</p>
<p>It is so often our interpretation of reality that gets us into trouble. And no-one is immune to skewed thinking.</p>
