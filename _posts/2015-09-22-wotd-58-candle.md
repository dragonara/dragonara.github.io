<p>Despite the fact that there is very rarely a need for candles, (even in Yorkshire we've had electricity for a while now) it is one of life's small pleasures to have them burning. They are a luxury, but a very simple one. They make my house feel like a home.</p>

<p>A few years ago when I first was brave enough to buy really pretty shoes, I wasn't sure if I should I wear them for work. Maybe I should keep them in a box and only wear them once a year?  It's very easy to think that we're not special enough for nice things. And that if we do treat ourselves to nice things that we should save them for a special occasion.</p>
<p>But it is liberating to wear red patent shoes to work, or to wear your favourite clothes just because they make us feel good.  Look for the simple things that allow you to connect to a happier, more successful state. It might be a hot bath, it might be a walk in the fresh air, it might be a cup of your favourite coffee.</p>
<p>It might be a candle kind of a day.</p>
