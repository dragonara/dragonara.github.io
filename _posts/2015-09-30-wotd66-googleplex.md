<p>I'm not sure whether the word was intended to be googolplex or Googleplex.</p>
<p>A googol is a really big number:</p>
<p>10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. A googolplex is a really, really, really, big number.</p>

<p>On the other hand the <a title="Pictures from a tour of the 'Plex" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-hq-office-tour-2013-10?op=1&amp;IR=T" target="_blank">Googleplex</a> is the headquarters of Google. Famously a workplace designed to be stimulating and creative; to foster great teams and make collaboration happen.</p>
<p>And I'm certain that the design, layout and decoration of our workplaces has a huge impact on how creative we feel, how well we work together, how we feel about work. Which is all well and good, except most of us feel powerless to change our working environment.</p>
<p>And while you might not be able to choose the office layout, or the colour of the walls, you can find a way to add a bit of personality to the environment, to make baby steps towards making a place you do your best work. Maybe it's a reminder of a piece of work, maybe it's a personal totem, maybe it's a book, a pen or a pot plant.</p>
<p>Maybe you can add one thing tomorrow.</p>
