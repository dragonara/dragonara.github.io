<p>Compassion is hard. It requires patience, kindnessÂ and involves putting ourselves at risk of living someone else's pain.</p>
<p>Sometimes though I think it is much easier to find compassion for the ones we love than for ourselves. It's like we think that by beating ourselves up we pay some kind of some kind of karmic dues. Or that berating ourself for our mistakes will stop us recommitting them. HA!</p>
<p>But maybe it's by acknowledging that we have compassion for others; that we can accept them for their imperfections we can learn to accept some of their own.</p>
