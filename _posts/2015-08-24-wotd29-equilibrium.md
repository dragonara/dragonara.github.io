<p>When it comes to the oft-discussed work-life balance I'm not sure it's possible, but like most things, its probably the ongoing efforts to find your equilibrium is the most important thing.  After all there will be times where your focus is work, there will be times where your focus is not work. And the ebb and flow of life is part of the deal.</p>
<p>I think equilibruim only exists from a distance...  Up close we all have moments of being torn. Maybe the key is to be in the moment and to strive to find some kind of macro balance. Balance your investment of time and energy on a monthly or yearly basis rather than daily or even moment-by-moment.</p>
