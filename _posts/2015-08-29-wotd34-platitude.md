<p>I try to avoid clichés like the plague...</p>
<p>(Purposeful irony ftw)</p>
<p>Language has the power to capture our attention, to surprise and delight us. Given that our attention is so thinly stretched, getting people to really engage with us is an absolute necessity. The world of work is littered with well-worn phrases, the kind of 'out of the box thinking', 'helicopter view', 'run it up the flag pole and see who salutes' nonsense that provokes endless games of b*****t bingo in meetings up and down the country.</p>
<p>Those clichés make our words lose their meaning and their impact.</p>
<p>Words are subtle and delicate tools that can make us a delight to listen to, platitudes, cliches and jargon are tedious, they tell our audience that we don't care enough about them to try and find a clearer, more intriguing way to express ourselves.</p>
<p>The only way to get good at being interesting is to practise, just because you have been talking for most of your life doesn't mean you can improve your ability to weave a story full of happy magic.</p>
