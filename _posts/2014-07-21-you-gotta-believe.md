<p>I believe that work can be fun and fulfilling, but you have to make it playful on purpose &amp; that takes effort &amp; discipline.</p>
<p>I grew up in a home where both my parents worked very hard, but they both hated their jobs. They hated going to work, day-in, day-out, the whole time I was growing up. It always seemed that they accepted that was the price of being a grownup. I have had jobs that I hated and jobs that I loved and consider myself very lucky to have found a job that allows me to work to my strengths and spend time doing work I enjoy with people who value my 'uniqueness'. But that makes me think of this...</p>

<blockquote><p>“I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it.” Thomas Jefferson</p></blockquote>
<p>And I have worked hard for the privilege - I work hard to find the time to do new stuff, work hard to fit the original job description into as appropriate space in my week as possible, work hard to learn and try new things and be willing muck stuff up.</p>
<p>And I have worked hard on being playful, despite other people's discomfort with that! Sometimes I do drawing, sometimes I laugh and sometimes I encourage other people to make cars out of vegetables or camels out of newspaper. It makes people uncomfortable and sometimes that is challenging. But entirely worth the effort.</p>
<blockquote><p><q>Find a job you love and you'll never work a day in your life. </q> - Confucius</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes my manager says you try too hard and aim for too close to perfection and he may have a point. But the work is fascinating and rewarding. Mainly because I get to contribute, people come to me and ask me to help, to join them, to work on projects, to coach them, to train them. And being able to be part of the community is a joy and a privilege as well as a job.</p>

<blockquote><p>“If a man is called to be a street sweeper, he should sweep streets even as Michelangelo painted, or Beethoven composed music, or Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause to say, here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well.” - Martin Luthor King</p></blockquote>
<p>And the point is that there are choices to be made, a choice to find the fun and the play and the creativity, especially when inspiration is distant and the work seems relentlessly grinding and joyless. It's tempting but too easy to throw up your hands and declare yourself "stuck" and the work "boring".</p>
<p>So whatever your work of choice is, parent, painter, teacher, doctor, road-sweeper, domestic technician, hedge-fund manager, or staff developer you have a choice, and dare I say a responsibility to find a way to contribute that gives you satisfaction.</p>
