<p>Set seems to be a fairly innocuous word. However according to <a title="Blimey factoid" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/help/faq/language/t47.html" target="_blank">Dictionary.com and the OED</a>, it has a scary 464 different meanings.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #333399;">464!Â </span> </strong></h2>
<p>For those of us who are native English speakers, the way we deal with words like set are by using context to add meaning. So if I am talking about setting a jelly you probably will assume that I mean making it solid (albeit deliciously wobbly) rather than setting it on table or setting it alight.</p>
<p>Which is all well and good except our brains are tricksy things and sometimes in the space between my not quite perfect communication and your super-busy brain, we find a rabbit hole to fall in. And even worse we might not realise that the two of us have had a whole conversation about 2 different things.</p>
<p>Sometimes that's because of words like set that have multiple meanings, or those helpful pronouns 'he', 'she', 'it' etc that are good at saving us repeating ourselves but sometimes stop us being specific enough for others to be sure of our meaning.</p>
<p>We also have a tendancy to use high concept words like family, success, love, friendship etc. these are words that mean different things to different people, if I apply my understanding of the word success to you that might lead me to make all kinds of unhelpful assumptions.</p>
<p>There are lots of these linguistic pitfalls and we're never going to be so masterful that we avoid them altogether, so be kind, to yourself and others. Plan to be misunderstood and have a plan to rectify it.</p>
