<p>In my line of work variety is a good thing. It keeps people engaged, it meets the needs of the different individuals in the group, it allows people to engage with materials in different ways to embed learning.</p>
<p>The trouble is that sometimes we're not the best judges of variety.</p>
<p>Recently I went for lunch with a friend, while I was checking out the menu and dithering over the food on offer, my friend looked at me and said that he knew what I would choose. "No", I scoffed, "all of these things to choose from, how could you know?". The trouble is that he did know. Because he had seen the pattern in what I thought were my random food choices.</p>
<p>So, as my illusions of variety were smacked in the nose, I wondered how often my belief that I am picking from the smorgasbord of training design options is disrupted by my preferences, in food, for cheese and bacon, in training, for pens and post-it-notes.</p>
<p>Part of those preferences are the unconscious expertise we build up when we do the same work for a long time, but how do we know we are challenging ourselves to do new things and take risks rather than staying in our comfort zone? As the Zen teacher Shunryu Suzuki writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>"In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few."</p></blockquote>
<p>Keeping ourselves fresh results from constantly adding to our list of inspirations; reading, collecting, learning. We also need new challenges and to listen carefully to the needs of the people we provide a service to.</p>
