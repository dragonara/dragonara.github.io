<p>I realised whilst getting over excited about learning technologies yesterday, that not only do I consider myself to be a geek; I wear the title as a badge of honour.</p>
<p>I may not be the geekiest person in the world but I am entirely happy to claim the description. Not that I consider myself some kind of circus freak (which is how the word was originally used) I prefer the idea of someone with an obsessive interest is a particular topic, and I am, after all, obsessive about a whole range of things. From the properties of various types of craft adhesive, to the best cross-stitch needles (gold-plated size 26) science, sums, theatre... Oh and I love the intricacies of the work I do, I am utterly geektastic about being a trainer and knowing stuff that might help the people I work with.<br />
So, you have been warned, if you bore easily try to avoid those topics of conversation, you may never escape!</p>
