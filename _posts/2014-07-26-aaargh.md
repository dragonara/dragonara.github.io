<p>Just* read this <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/management/columnistgeorgecloutier/article207280.html">article</a> (thanks Twitter) by George Cloutier and am quite grumpy. Then I read this <a href="http://leadchangegroup.com/biased-justification-for-poor-leadership/">response</a> by Mike Henry. Now am slightly less grumpy.</p>
<p>Cloutier says " A company is not a democracy. The only opinion that counts is that of ownership." Really?? I didn't realise that company owners had to be omniscient, if they do, who on earth would be brave enough to set themselves up for that fall? Surely we all want to work in teams where are our specialist expertise is valued, where we bring something to the table that is ours and ours alone.</p>
<p>He also says that fear is the best motivator, yes it is, but only if you want to make people utterly avoid risk and aspire to mediocrity.</p>
