<p>I see so many misunderstandings of power. From those that believe they don't have any, those that think their power comes from their position in the <a title="WotD10 â€“ Hierarchy" href="http://helenwalker.net/2015/08/05/wotd10-hierarchy/">hierarchy</a> or their muscle mass.</p>
<p>The main one I see is a failure to recognise our role in empowering others. When we coach them, ask them questions, trust them to solve their own problems, allow them to use their expertise we add value to our community as well as affecting change.</p>
<p>True power comes from service, from the vulnerability of not having all the answers, from honouring the uniqueness of others and allowing them to shine. If you have to wield your power as a threat to others, then all you have is short-term power.</p>
