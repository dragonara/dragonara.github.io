<p>The mistake that people make is to assume that leadership only happens when your role demands it, that is how the world works isn't it? There are leaders and then there is everyone else. Now there is nothing wrong with being a follower, far from it, but that's a post for another day.</p>
<p>Today's post is about leadership. Not the chance to be in charge and to tell people what to do, but rather choice to make a difference and to affect change.  To take care of others in your community.</p>
<p>And there's a real challenge there; who thinks they are really good enough to be *that* person. To have your voice heard above everyone else's.</p>
<p>Often attributed to Nelson Mandela, it was Marianne Williamson who wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you <i>not</i> to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people will not feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give others permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't think you have to believe in any God to see the truth of that.</p>
<p>Leadership is a choice, it can be a long-term choice, 20 years or more in a CEO position, or it can be a short-term choice, one project, one idea.</p>
<p>We look for lots of leaders, for leaders of thought, of faith, of politics, of values. In our businesses, our communities and our families. So why couldn't you be part of that group?</p>
<p>Give yourself permission to take your place in the Pantheon. And if you don't want to? I do.</p>
