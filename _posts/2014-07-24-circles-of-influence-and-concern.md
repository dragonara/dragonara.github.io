<p>Pretty much everyone I've worked with in leadership training, coaching, mentoring or action learning over the past few years has seen me draw circles on the flip-chart or in my notepad. Of my two favourite circle models, and the one that has challenged me the most is the Covey model of Circles of Concern and Circles of Influence.<!--more--><br />
Covey says that if you imagine all the things that interest<a href="http://helenwalker.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/CirclesofConcern.gif"><img class="alignright wp-image-123" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/CirclesofConcern.gif" alt="CirclesofConcern" width="352" height="264" /></a> or involve you contained within a circle then this is the <em>circle of concern</em> and the things that you can influence or change can be described by a smaller circle (the <em>circle of influence</em>) that sits inside that.Â  So you can see that we have influence over some but not all of the things we are concerned about.</p>
<p>For instance the weather is something that sometimes you might be interested in, but you have no control over, this sits in the green outer circle on the diagram. Deciding what to do or whether to wear a coat in response to the weather sits in the blue inner circle.</p>
<p>We all have situations we'd like to change. I bet you can think of at least one thing in your working life you wish was different. The challenge is seeing where we can influence a situation or indeed recognising when we can't influence it and accepting that rather than becoming frustrated.</p>
<p>And of course this is a lot to get your head round, I have to challenge myself to remember that there is usually much more I can do to influence a situation than it might appear at first. I can't change someone else or their behaviour, but I can help them make those changes or change my understanding of it, and by doing that I can change how I respond to it. Covey suggests that the way to grow our circle of influence is to be proactive rather than reactive. Indeed being proactive is the first of his seven habits.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The difference between people who exercise initiative and those who don't is literally the difference between night and day. I'm not talking about a 25 to 50 percent difference in effectiveness; I'm talking about a <strong>5000-plus percent</strong> difference particularly if they are smart, aware and sensitive to others." Steven R Covey, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</p></blockquote>
<p>The key element of being proactive is taking responsibility for helping to resolve a situation, instead of looking to blame someone else or allowing a sense of powerlessness to render action impossible. Often a small action is the way to start, talk to someone outside the situation, identify some options. Look for inspiration, what would your smartest colleague do? What would your best friend do? What would you do if you knew you couldn't fail?<br />
Try a small step and see what happens. You might surprise yourself.</p>
