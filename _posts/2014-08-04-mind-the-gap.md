<p>Reading Steven Covey's "The 8th Habit" I was reflecting on his use of the Victor Frankl description of the gap that exists between stimulus and response.</p>

London: Simon &amp; Schuster.[/caption]He describes the idea that when something happens "to us" we have a choice to make about how we respond to it. Often, he says, people fail to recognise that this gap exists and therefore are unable to make a choice. The ability to be able to make a choice about our responses in any given situation can be the difference between building and damaging relationships, exerting and restraining our influence or success and failure.</p>
<p>Covey says that our upbringing and our environment have an impact on the size of the gap that individuals experience; that for some people the gap can feel tiny or non-existent. Whilst for others the gap feels bigger, and so the opportunity to reflect on the number of choices that are available seems longer, providing a better opportunity to choose wisely.</p>
<p>So if the size of the gap is influence by those factors, does that mean it's fixed? I would say not. I think the short-term impact of life events, lack of sleep, overwhelming day-to-day pressures that can shrink the gap, even when people are usually more resourceful. Conversely, we are all able to add to our bank of choices. Finding new choices, working out new responses sometimes requires our beliefs, about the rules, about ourselves or about others, to be challenged or it requires the fresh perspective that comes from observing others, reading widely or reflecting on our experiences.</p>
<p>So when you feel challenged by a difficult situation remember that gap. Being aware of it, and building on the range of choices you have to pick from will help you feel more resourceful and in control.</p>
