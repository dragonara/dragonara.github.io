<p>I've been a feminist for as long as I can remember. And even after 30 years I'm still struggling with what that means. And what's worse the word feminist has somehow become pejorative.</p>
<p>For me feminism is about equality of opportunity. It is about the right to be imperfect. The right to be a mass of contradictions; strong and weak; happy and sad; independent and part of our families and communities.</p>
<p>Feminism is about the right to embrace my femininity and my strength, to wear lipstick and heels if I want or to choose trainers and bare face.</p>
<p>I'm a feminist because I believe in women and I believe in men.  I believe in the collective strength of people. Of course, it's a high ideal and I still mess up being a feminism, but I'm a work in progress.</p>
