<p>I'm a staff developer. That means that I believe that people can evolve, change, grow.</p>
<p>The strange thing is how difficult it is for people to believe about themselves. Most of us believe that our personalities are somehow set in stone. That we are how we are.</p>
<p>That just isn't true.</p>
<p>Of course you have to want to make the change.</p>
<p>And you have to have a plan. A picture of what better looks like.</p>
<p>Imagine that if you were going to make a small change of in the direction that you want to change. Not a 1% improvement, but a tenth of 1% improvement, a teeny-tiny baby step. If everyday you are one part in a thousand better than you were the day before it would only take 2 years to be 100% better.</p>
<p>So what do you want to be? Braver? Kinder? More patient? Calmer? More outspoken? What is the first <strong>tiny</strong> step towards that?</p>
<p>Make a plan and start tomorrow.</p>
