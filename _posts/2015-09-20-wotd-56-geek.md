<p>I do enjoy <a title="Geekery" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/07/23/geekery/">geekery;</a> mine and other people's. It really doesn't matter whether their fascination is for food, art, wine, Shakespeare, or Doctor Who.</p>
<p>The way they explain things? The way their eyes light up? Their fondness for the detail of their particular obsession? Joyful.</p>
