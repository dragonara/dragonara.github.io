<p>Today's word is generating about a thousand thoughts, so picking one is going to be tricky.</p>
<p>It's been A'Â Level results time this week, and I was talking to a friend about his daughter's disappointing results. I remember that feeling of the world being about those letters on a piece of paper. That that was somehow a measure of what I had spent the last 2 years learning. But now more than 20 years later I don't remember much of what happened in those 2 years, so really was that learning? Can I solve a differential equation? Can I explain how lenses in a telescope work? Can I tell you the tests for inorganic metals? Ummmmm. Not without a lot of googling!</p>
<p>Now as someone who tries to help other people learn, I realise what I am trying to do is help them learn to behave differently. To help them identify what their options are and to make choices that feel informed and powerful. And I think that's a different kind of learning from the kind that I experienced in my A' Level maths class. It certainly involves a different kind of answer.</p>
<p>Coaching people and training people is a way to give them more tools for their tool box, more frameworks for understanding situations and people and allowing them to work out what motivation they have or can muster for the journey of change.</p>
<p>Fundamentally learning is hard because change is hard, it requires energy and thought and focus. You need to be willing to take risks and fail. So it helps to have an advocate, a mentor, a coach or a friend who will understand that finding it hard is not the same as giving up.</p>
<p>And so to today's post it...</p>
