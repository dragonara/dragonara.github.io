<p>Wit is such a lovely word, and thinking about today's post-it made me think about the danger of wit. There is something in the concept of wit that I realised was a bit sharp and pointy. So while I like the idea of being witty I think it's probably good to temper that with warmth.</p>
<p>Is it odd to enjoy some letters more than others, maybe it's the vanity of having a 'W' initial? Anyway my post-it note has developed (what I consider) a kind of alliterative charm, leading to a statement of intent about the kind of human being I want to be.  I could have made a longer list - but I honestly think this is enough to keep me out of mischief!!</p>
