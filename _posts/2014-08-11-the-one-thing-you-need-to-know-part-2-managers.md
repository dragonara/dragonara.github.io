<p>So, the second thing that Marcus Buckingham writes about in "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/One-Thing-You-Need-Know/dp/1416502963/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1281279148&amp;sr=1-5">The one thing you need to know</a>" is for Managers. His 'one thing' for them is:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Discover what is unique about each person and capitalise on it".</p></blockquote>
<p>I really like this advice to managers. Helping each member of your team to recognise their unique talent and allowing them time to develop those talents works on several different levels.</p>
<p>Critically it proves that you are paying attention, which seems such a small thing, but I think is really important for people. That then helps to build their confidence, by giving them feedback on things they are doing well so that they value those talents and are more likely to replicate them.</p>
<p>I know that someÂ  managers would argue that giving people permission to focus their energy on what might be a small part of their role would distract them from other critical task, but I think that by giving them encouragement to work on their areas of strength, and refocussing their energies into work they enjoy, that their overall enjoyment of their role and motivation will increase, allowing them to do the interesting stuff and focus on how satisfying that is rather than the frustrations of the bits of the job they find challenging or dull.</p>
