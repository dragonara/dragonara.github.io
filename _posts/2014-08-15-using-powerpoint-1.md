<p>I know that there are a whole group of people who think that PowerPoint is the work of the devil. And trust me, I have seen some fairly dire things done with PowerPoint, but most of those things happen because of the way people use it, and have very little to do with PowerPoint itself. And whilst there are alternate tools for presenting, such as <a title="Prezi homepage" href="http://prezi.com/index/">Prezi</a> and <a href="http://www.haikudeck.com/">Haiku Deck</a>, that are designed to help avoid some of the common issues with presentations, I'm not convinced that they can overcome the problems that come from the way we write presentation materials.</p>
<p>First of all the question is, do you really know if your presentations are any good? And if they're not, do you know how to start to make them better?</p>
<p>I think a good starting point is to consider how you would answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you clear about how you and your presentation are going to help your audience. What is the purpose of your presentation? Is it as clear to your audience as it is to you? Are you sharing information in the hopes that they will draw the necessary conclusion or take the necessary action? Have you made that leap explicit? <em>Understanding is often insufficient, presentations should move people to action.</em></li>
<li>Have you considered what it's going to be like for your audience to listen to your presentation? Are you explaining how your narrative fits together? Are you expecting them to understand the individual ideas in your presentation as well as how all the ideas fit together into a coherent argument or story? Is there a way to make your individual ideas clearer or more engaging.</li>
<li>How do you handle your presentation nerves? Apologising for the 'dull' bits or packing your slides with information might seem like an excellent idea, but if you want people to buy your ideas and change, learn or do something, then you need to connect with them, not hide behind your presentation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before you start writing your presentation think carefully about its purpose and the story you want to tell your audience. This will enable you to think about how to make sure that whatever tool you use it will help you communicate effectively.</p>
