<p>Today's word <em>plague</em> instantly reminded me of Mercutio from Romeao and Juliet, famously cursing his friend, Romeo's, family and Juliet's...</p>
<blockquote><p>ask for me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I <span style="line-height: 1.71429; font-size: 1rem;">am peppered, I warrant, for this world. <strong>A plague o'</strong></span><span style="line-height: 1.71429; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>both your houses</strong>! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a </span><span style="line-height: 1.71429; font-size: 1rem;">cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a </span><span style="line-height: 1.71429; font-size: 1rem;">rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of </span><span style="line-height: 1.71429; font-size: 1rem;">arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I </span><span style="line-height: 1.71429; font-size: 1rem;">was hurt under your arm.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Mercutio is Romeo's mate, they hang out and talk about girls. Mercutio is a lot less enamoured with the idea of love than Romeo, so it's not really a surprise that when Romeo falls for, and quickly marries Juliet in secret, he doesn't tell his friend. This means when Juliet's cousin challenges Romeo to a dual, not only does Romeo not want to fight him, Mercutio thinks that Romeo is being a bit rubbish.</p>
<p>Mercutio fights in Romeo's stead:</p>

<p>Mercutio dies at the hands of Tybalt which drives the play towards inevitable tragedy.</p>
<p>You can understand Mercutio's anger, it's easy to be angry when other people let us down, or when bad things happen by chance. The question is, when the anger subsides, what do you do next?</p>
