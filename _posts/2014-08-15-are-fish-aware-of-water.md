<p>I have come to a point where what I think is no longer helping. It's not helping me be happy, it's not helping me succeed. I know how I got to this point, understand how my life & experiences have formed me into the woman I am. How they have shaped my beliefs about the world. But there is a big gap between understanding that and being able to change it.</p>
<p>And I need to change things. Not everything, but one of those things I learnt so long ago it is woven into the fabric of lots of how I think about the world. And I can see that my logic is illogical. The trouble is, like a fish, I can't tell that I'm in water.</p>
<p>In his 2005 Kenyon College Commencement speech, David Foster Wallace (<a href="http://moreintelligentlife.co.uk/story/david-foster-wallace-in-his-own-words">transcript</a>) tells this story.</p>
<blockquote><p>There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says "Morning, boys. How's the water?" And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes "What the hell is water?"</p></blockquote>
<p>If I think my logic is flawed, then how do I learn to be different, how do I stop myself repeating the same patterns over and over again? </p>
<p>I can't imagine that I'm unusual in this. Our ideas about the world are so much a part of our thought processes, that it's difficult to untangle them. They might play out in my interactions, but I don't know how visible they are. It's one thing to know your beliefs are unhelpful, it's another thing to change them.</p>
<p>So, what next? Recruit allies, be aware, allow myself time for learning to be different. And breathe.</p>
