<p>There are some things that are just fundamental to the way that I design training and development events. The first of these fundamental principals was "<a title="First principles – part 1" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/09/23/first-principles-part-1/" target="_blank">respect participant knowledge</a>". The next one is the <strong>power of the group</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://helenwalker.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bridgeballistrade.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-482" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bridgeballistrade.jpg" alt="bridgeballistrade" width="395" height="296" /></a>I love working with groups, and there is something magical that happens when you see people start to build relationships with others in the room. Sharing their ideas and challenges.</p>
<p>I find it is particularly helpful when there is an unspoken belief that a particular skill is "easy". Seeing other smart, capable people struggling to find simple answers is a good reminder that often there are no simple answers. What a relief!</p>
<p>Attending training courses can be quite scary and intimidating for the participants, you are asked to be in that place where you don't know things and asked questions, If you come on one of my training courses there will probably be lots of felt-tip pens and sheets of flip chart paper. Some people find themselves outside their comfort zone.</p>
<p>Asking participants to work in groups on activities before reporting back helps allay some of this anxieties. If they have questions they are more likely to ask, if there blind spots in their knowledge they can share the things they do know about and if they are not a natural contributor they can chose how much they share.</p>
