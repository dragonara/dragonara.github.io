<p>Such a lovely word that describes the quality of being real. And <a title="WotD18 – Pseudo" href="http://helenwalker.net/2015/08/13/wotd18-pseudo/">authenticity</a> is an important quality for our work and our relationships.  Authenticity is about a sense of congruence; an agreement between what you say and how you act.</p>
<p><a title="Wayne discussing the word Pseudo" href="http://waynehanley.com/blog/2015/08/13/doodle-a-day-day-18/" target="_blank">Wayne offered</a> the other perspective to this and he's completely right that there are some things that we don't share, but is that simply a mask? Sometimes. At other times I think It's more a choice about which things we choose to reveal and which we choose to keep to ourselves. After all I don't need to tell you every little thing about myself in order to be authentic (thank goodness!)</p>
<p>And I think they key word there is choice. Choosing to disclose or not disclose my opinions or values because they may undermine my effectiveness is one thing, feeling pressured to be a particular way or behave in a particular way is entirely another.</p>
<p>Being real, exhibiting verisimilitude, is as much about action than it is about words. Trusting people comes from a sense that we can predict their actions, that we understand their decisions and their values.</p>
<p>The people who are easiest to trust have clear values, even if we don't agree we can build on those solid foundations. Those who have different rules for different people or situations leave us with a challenging sense of disquiet.</p>
