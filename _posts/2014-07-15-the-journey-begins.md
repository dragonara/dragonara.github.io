<blockquote>"It's a dangerous business going out of your door. You step onto the road and if you don't keep your feet there's no telling where you might be swept off to."</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now I feel like Bilbo Baggins. For a while I've been enjoying my warm hobbit hole and despite security that offers and now it's time to set off on an adventure. This isn't the story of dwarves and a hobbit; this is the story of a woman building a website and making some fun things. There will probably be a fire-breathing dragon or two along the way and I will have to face some scary-ass demons, but I am armed with pens and post-it notes; what could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>And I've been reluctant to start. Scared to put fingers to keyboard. But even if this is a disaster I have to do it. HAVE TO. I'm compelled, both by the need to explore and celebrate the work I am privileged to do and by my allies, colleagues &amp; own personal Gandalf.</p>
<p>And now that I'm started, I'm excited, let the giddy begin.</p>
