<p>When I design training I am providing an opportunity for people to identify and choose some new ways of doing things. This means that motivation is as important as explanation.</p>
<p>Sometimes it seems that training is just about sharing new information, rather than describing the benefits of change and helping to map a new set of actions. I like this quote: </p>
<blockquote><p>"Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better." - Maya Angelou </p></blockquote>
<p>I know that part of knowing better is being able to decide what 'better' is. Having choices, not just skills.</p>
