<p>I love Seth Godin's blog, he manages to say in a few words what I am still struggling to express coherently. This <a title="I Made it My Mission" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/08/i-made-it-my-mission.html" target="_blank">post </a>talks about the value of colleagues who have taken it upon themselves to identify something they care enough about to tackle it head on. They are the folks on a mission.</p>
<p>I've been lucky enough to work with a few of them in my time and the thing I'm always impressed with is how much they can achieve. The energy that they pour into their mission is much higher than could be explained by whatever remuneration package is on offer and there's a bit of me that suspects that is the last reason they do it. For those people on a mission what they want to see is change. They have found something about the world that makes no sense. Something that they think should be sorted out. And they are brave enough to see that they can make a difference, and to actually try.</p>
<p>My colleagueÂ  and I have been organising this thing called the <a title="HudSnug" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6fv5H5USTM">HudSnug</a>. (That's his idea and name!) The HudSnug is an opportunity for that those colleagues we have who are on a mission to come together and share, motivate, think, work and play with their great ideas.</p>
<p>It's a great place to share ideas and discuss our plans. And small as it is, it has become one of the highlights of my working life. There's something so brilliant about sitting listening to people talk about the stuff that makes their eyes light up. And I really believe that all that energy and motivation is precious, it effects change, it turns into action. We need more of it in the organisation. And because those missions are sometimes vulnerable to the beauracracy of organisations and the whims of less helpful colleagues we need to protect them.</p>
<p>Just sitting and discussing ideas, being heard, seeing other people respond with curiosity, enthusiasm is enough to reconnect us with our purpose.</p>
