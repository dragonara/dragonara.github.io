<p>I love to work with people as a coach.</p>
<p>Of course the purpose of coaching is to allow people a forum in which they can solve the issues that they face. A place where they can talk things through and really start to understand the layers of thinking about a problem.</p>
<p>In some ways having a coach feels like having a friend, but there are really important differences. Sometimes what we want from our friends is a chance to rant and grumble, a chance to threaten to spit in people's tea or lie on the floor and have a big paddy.</p>
<p>While you can try that with your coach the likelihood is that they will encourage you to take a breath and work out what you are going to do, helping you to find a way forward when you are stuck. By allowing you to be where you are, strengths, weaknesses and all, they give you the opportunity to be your own friend and identify the best way forward.</p>
<p>And often the joy of working with a coach is that through the conversation you come up with new ideas, new ways of understanding the predicament, new options.</p>
