<p>The joy of delivering training is watching people learn, and people in my business often talk about the 'lightbulb moment' as their benchmark for success or a handy indicator that the content is working, and, to a certain extent, I agree. But I also think that some of the best learning is hard-fought for.</p>
<p>What do I mean by "best"? If you define learning as a change in behaviour or performance then for me best would not necessarily be the quickest or the easiest change. I think rather it would be practised and rehearsed, trialled and errored, taken on over time, so as it becomes consciously adopted, rather than accidentally fallen into and then taken for granted.</p>
<blockquote><p>Learning is a skill and like any other skill one that needs to be practised and refined. As such valuing the experience of learning and not just the end result is key.</p></blockquote>
<p>Conscious, reflective learning is hard, it requires time and energy, but the impact of it can be huge and I suspect learning done in this way is more likely to spiral into other areas. Learning how you learn, learning about yourself as a learner, becoming a playful, experimental and curious learner allows you the chance to excel and to achieve mastery in whatever form you choose.</p>
