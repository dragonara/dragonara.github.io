<p>The notion of hierarchy is an uncomfortable one for me. Why do organisations need a hierarchy, is it because we think that there is a special section of the population who are allowed to lead and the rest of us are comfortable to be led? I don't think that's true. So why maintain those structures?</p>
<p>Maybe it's to give us a sense of who has the influence and who we should listen to? But influence is much more complicated than that one single idea.  In his book, Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, <a title="Video - The secrets of persuasion" href="https://youtu.be/cFdCzN7RYbw?t=7s" target="_blank">Robert Cialdini</a> says that there are 6 main sources of influence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reciprocity</li>
<li>Commitment and consistency</li>
<li>Social Proof</li>
<li>Liking</li>
<li>Authority</li>
<li>Scarcity</li>
</ol>
<p>Number 5 is the partly about positional authority, but also about credibility and technical knowledge. So where does that leave our idea of hierarchy?</p>
<p>Is hierarchy simply one of a number of ways of taking a measure of influence? There are lots of ways of ways of ranking people, some of them you will find meaningful, some of them less so. Pick the ones you think are important and work on building your rank in that one area.</p>

<p>As Jimmy Stewart's character in the film Harvey says:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Years ago my mother used to say to me, she'd say, "In this world, Elwood, you must be," — she always called me Elwood — "In this world, you must be oh so smart, or oh so pleasant." Well, for years I was smart. I recommend pleasant. You may quote me."</p></blockquote>
<p>Let's see what Wayne makes of all that...</p>
