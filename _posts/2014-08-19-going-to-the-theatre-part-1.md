<p>One of the most inspiring experiences for me is a trip to the theatre, but not just any kind of theatre and not just any kind of trip.</p>
<p>For the last seven years I have been going to Stratford-Upon-Avon and seeing productions at the Royal Shakespeare Company's three theatres. To date I have seen almost 20 productions there, and the experience has been almost entirely breath-taking.</p>
<p>So why do I keep going back? What is it that experience gives me? Why I value it as much as I do?</p>

<p>First of all, I think the distance is really important. It's almost impossible to get to by train to Stratford from home in less than 3 and a half hours. It would be easy to see this as a major disadvantage or a logistic nightmare, but it means that I have to plan and look forward to the trip, and I can't just fritter it away on a wet Tuesday evening. If I'm going all that way I usually go and see more than one play in a visit, probably the only reason I saw the utterly fantastical King John last summer* was that I was going to see something else and wanted to make the most of the trip.</p>
<p>The time of getting there and getting home and the time spent in the town are also really good for making sure that there is a window of time to reflect the experience. One of the things I am really aware of with the theatre is its impermanence. So much of our cultural diet exists in a pretty permanent state, film, music, TV... Recorded and replayed for as long as we want. Theatre productions tend to only exist for the time that they are on, and it's easy to lose them over time, and be left with a few vestigia of images and feelings. Spending time thinking and talking about the plays gives me a slightly more solid set of memories to sit alongside my souvenir programmes and postcards.</p>

<p>Added to all of this, Stratford is a beautiful and cosy kind of town that exists in its own little tourist-laden bubble. People go there mainly to see the theatre, so even when you travel solo there will be people in your B&amp;B or in the shops who have seen the plays or at least heard about them.<br />
So without even starting to talk about the productions themselves, I think that a valuable part of the experience for me are the rituals and the structures put around the trips that separate them from my day-to-day life. These allow me to really make the most of the wonderful experience of going to the theatre there.</p>
