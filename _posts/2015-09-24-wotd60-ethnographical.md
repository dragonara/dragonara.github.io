<p>Ethnography is the study of peoples and cultures.</p>
<p>A big part of my job is to try and work with organisational culture, to work with what exists to create change. After all culture is the thread that ties us together, the rules (spoken and unspoken), the narratives that we share with each other. We can't change much if we don't change that. And that's difficult because seeing the culture we exist in is hard, sometimes we need to talk to outsiders, sometimes we need to have outsiders hold a mirror up to us.</p>
<p>But you can't change if you don't know where you're starting from.</p>
