<p>I think that my love of <a title="Prezi" href="http://prezi.com/index/" target="_blank">Prezi</a> (the zooming presentation software) is pretty well-known by my colleagues, and sometimes people are surprised that I don't use it for every training course, event and presentation that I plan. Last week I was co-delivering a new course "Presenting with Presence!" that I developed with another colleague at the University, I pulled together the presentation to support the course. As with all my presentation-related sessions I decided to use PowerPoint rather than anything else. But why?</p>
<p>The main reason is that most people still use PowerPoint to deliver the majority of their teaching, training and presentations. Changing to another presentation package doesn't really address the problem. After all those problems are a result of the way that people put presentations together. And even though there is lots of presentation training available, those problems don't seem to be addressed. There is a major temptation to use PowerPoint to bury people in information or to use it as an action-packed distraction from the discomfort of presenting.</p>
<p>I'd like people to understand that they have options in the way that they present. If it seems that the only option to a better, clearer presentation is to get to grips with a whole new bit of software then that is a significant barrier to change. Now, I'm not holding myself up as a paragon of presentation design, but I know that my PowerPoint presentations do tend to look very different from a lot of the others that I see. So if people see that PowerPoint can produce something that looks very different from the standard bullet pointed slides then they might be tempted to try something different.</p>
<p>The other factor for me is that I still like the cleanness and polish of PowerPoint. I still think that sometimes Prezi is too informal for some situations. I also find co-editing, sharing presentations, providing handouts, and the other assorted parenthetic activities a little smoother with PowerPoint. Having said that, the rate with which Prezi changes means that that's unlikely to be the case for very much longer</p>
