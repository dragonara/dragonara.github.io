<p>I caused a bit of a hoo-ha while delivering the last session of my "Getting Ready for Leadership" programme last year.</p>
<p>The programme is for colleagues who are aspiring to their first leadership role. As usual, the course was full of ambitious, interesting people who are keen to progress in their careers. Overall the focus of the programme is on personal effectiveness and reflecting on the challenges of taking on a management role. The last session examines ideas relating to career progression and reflects on what that career path might look like for the participants.</p>
<p>As part of that session <img class="alignright  wp-image-125" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/GRFLCareerPlanning2013.gif" alt="GRFLCareerPlanning2013" width="322" height="242" /> the group are asked to reflect on what constitutes their personal brand (you can see the instruction slide here). It's a challenging exercise because it requires a considerable step from the earlier activities to get to the point where they can commit their ideas to paper (and it doesn't help that there is drawing!). However I think that some of the group weren't happy with was the idea of marketing themselves as a "product".</p>
<p>I understand that this might be uncomfortable; so why do I ask them to do it?<br />
A key part of managing your career progression is understanding who you are at work and what value you bring to any organisation you work for. Understanding how others see you, where your strengths and weaknesses lie, the kind of work you prefer is a critical part of being effective in your role.</p>
<p>Imagine applying for a job with that clear understanding. Imagine how much more straightforward filling in a job application would be if you were confident about who you are and what makes not just employable but unique and of value.</p>
<p>Of course, I know that there are distinct challenges with that. Describing our strengths is difficult, it makes us feel uncomfortable. Most people struggle to say a sentence that starts with "I'm really good at..." out loud. They hesitate, make a joke, backtrack or undermine themselves. I'm not advocating the kind of unbearable self-assurance that most of us are worried about demonstrating, but rather a sense of understanding our own value.</p>
<p>I wonder whether we need to think about where the benchmark is? Do we need to really talk about how we evaluate our contribution, and accept the vulnerability of learning to be better.  Can we allow ourselves to be given the credit for doing the best we can and see the impact that we have on other people. Can we be brave enough to seek out and trust the <a title="Feedback – breakfast of champions" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/07/26/feedback-breakfast-of-champions/">feedback</a> of others.</p>
