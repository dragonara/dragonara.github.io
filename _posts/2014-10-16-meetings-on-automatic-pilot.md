<p>Delivering training on "l<a title="Course details" href="https://www.hud.ac.uk/hr/staffdevelopment/coursedetail/index.php?courseId=8610" target="_blank">eading effective meetings"</a> this morning, I talked a lot about the changing the culture of meetings.</p>
<p>How many meetings do you attend a week? And how many of them feel useful? Come to that, how many do you actually enjoy? It may seem like an optimistic notion but how many meetings do you come out of feeling happier, inspired or more focused on the task at hand?  Does that seem like the whim of Pollyannaish staff developer?</p>
<p>All too often it seems that we plan meetings on automatic pilot, as if the main things we needed to consider were who should be <a href="http://helenwalker.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/flagshadows.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-480" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/flagshadows.jpg" alt="flagshadows" width="448" height="252" /></a>there. when we could all meet, whether the room was big enough for that many people and whether we could get away with ordering the posh catering.</p>
<p>Instead of planning identi-kit meetings that all seem the same, today we discussed a design approach to meetings.</p>
<p>Start with <strong>purpose</strong>...</p>
<p>Why have a meeting, what are you trying to achieve...?  And if your purpose is "we need to talk about project x or idea y" then go back and try again. Ask yourself what outcomes you would really like to achieve? Real, solid outcomes.</p>
<p>Use your purpose to drive everything else, from where and when, to who to invite. And make sure that you don't fall into the trap of planning a meeting that looks like every other meeting you've been to this week, just because supposedly that's how we do things round here.  You don't have to sit one group of people round one big boardroom-style table, you can break them up into pairs or groups, you can get them to draw things or make a picture out of post-it notes.  You can meet for 10 minutes or 35 minutes. Go on, I dare you!</p>
<p>My favourite moment today was someone saying "this is hard isn't it?". Because, do you know what? Yes, it is. This kind of cultural change is massively challenging, people might not like your ideas to start with.  The ideas might take a while to play with and test out. But it's a good challenge. Meetings should be better.</p>
