<p>I hate the word "expert".</p>
<p>It makes me massively uncomfortable. I feel it on the rare occassions that it's applied to me, but actually it doesn't matter who we're talking about. I think that even when you know something about a subject, even if you know lots about a subject, mainly what you know is how much you don't know.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's ignorance." - Confucius</p></blockquote>
<p>And as a trainer I think other people's perceptions of my expertise can be really damaging, it can get in the way of them asking questions, challenging me when I'm the person stood at the front.Â <strong>Credibility</strong> (the quality of being trusted and believable) on the other hand is all important. I want people to trust me, to trust what that I believe what I'm saying and will try and help them as much as possible. A key facet of credibility is owning up when you don't know the answer or when you are still working on what the answer might be.</p>
<p>I want to be seen as credible, but please don't call me an expert!</p>
