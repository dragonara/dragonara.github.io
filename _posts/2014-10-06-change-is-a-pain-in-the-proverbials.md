<p>It's a cliche that change is hard.</p>
<p>Or maybe its a truism?</p>
<p>Or perhaps it's both?</p>
<p>What ever that thing is, the other thing is that change is necessary.  And I hate that! Ok, I don't want to wake up in 10 years time with exactly the same life that I have now, but there are days when I just feel exhausted by it, worn down to the bones of myself by the amount of change, the pace of change and the unrelenting arrrrghghghghghghghghhhhhh of it all.</p>
<p>The problem (if indeed it is a<a href="http://helenwalker.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sticks1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-465" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/sticks1.jpg" alt="sticks" width="448" height="336" /></a> problem) is that I want to be in control. I want to steer my life and make stuff happen, and the thing is, sometimes that just doesn't work. You know what they say about God laughing when we make plans? Yeah, that!  I want to be a go with the flow, kind of person, but I think that's unlikely to ever really stick. But perhaps for a while I can pretend?</p>
<p>So this week I am going to be a <a title="Pooh-Sticks" href="http://www.pooh-sticks.com/content/rules" target="_blank">pooh stick</a> and see where the current takes me.</p>
