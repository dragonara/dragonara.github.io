<p>A while ago I ran a session for a team of creative colleagues where (inspired by <a href="http://www.austinkleon.com/2011/03/30/how-to-steal-like-an-artist-and-9-other-things-nobody-told-me/">Austin Kleon</a> and his book: Steal Like an Artist) I <a href="http://helenwalker.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2011-11-09-09.56.34.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-195" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2011-11-09-09.56.34.jpg" alt="2011-11-09 09.56.34" width="351" height="210" /></a>asked them to reflect on the things that inspired them. I <em>obviously</em> had to reflect on my own inspirations in order to do that.</p>
<p>I found it an interesting prompt, and the results seemed to be a map of where I had been, where I was right then and where I am heading.</p>
<p>Some of the things that inspire me are things I have been carrying with me for a long time, they have become old friends that remind me of the foundations that got me here. Then there are the things that make me happy right now, that remind me that I am doing OK day-to-day, they provide the principles that I work with and that help me make decisions to build a life and a career around. Then there are those that move me forward, give me something to aim at, aspire to. They remind me that I'm not done having fun.</p>
<p>The other thing I enjoyed about it was seeing the patterns emerge out of the seeming chaos, things that didn't seem to fit together suddenly did. Themes became clear and connections much more evident.</p>
<p>So my next few blog posts will explore some of those themes and connections</p>
