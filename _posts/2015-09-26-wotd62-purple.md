<p>Why should you care about that? Well only because I think that when life is a bit crappy, as it sometimes is, you have to know what simple small things are going to make you 5% cheerier.   </p>

<p>And more than happier, it's good to know what things are a link to your <a title="WotD18 – Pseudo" href="http://helenwalker.net/2015/08/13/wotd18-pseudo/" target="_blank">authenticity.</a> Because goodness knows sometimes the world wants to drag you away from your centre and make you more ordinary, so you fit in better. But the truth is that you are a better you when you celebrate your uniqueness. </p>
<div>If it's not purple, then what is it? Find it, celebrate it, put it on a t-shirt or in your wallet.</div>
