In<a title="Going to the theatre: part 1" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/08/19/going-to-the-theatre-part-1/"> part 1</a> of this post I talked about the rituals built around my theatre trips that make them more enjoyable. But all that wouldn't be worth a great deal if the actual theatre itself wasn't worth the distance, the time and the memory space.<br />
Having been to lots of theatres and seen lots of different kinds of productions, my experience at the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) has been very different from all the others, but why?</p>

<p>Well first of all the theatres (since the <a title="Transformation of the RST" href="http://www.rsc.org.uk/transformation/">transformation</a> of the new Royal Shakespeare Theatre (RST) complex) in Stratford all have thrust stages. What difference does that make? This means that the audience are sitting around three sides of the stage rather just one as they would be with a more standard proscenuim arch set up. Not only does this make for a more dynamic style of action, where actors are constantly moving to make sure that you don't get stuck looking at the back of anyone's head for too long, it also means that you tend to be much closer to the stage and therefore can actually see what the actors are doing without the use of a telescope (or the more standard opera glasses) As a result the experience is much more intimate, especially in <a title="The Swan Theatre" href="http://www.rsc.org.uk/visit-us/swan/">the Swan</a>, which has a capacity of about 450.</p>

<p>The most important thing about these theatres and the RSC itself is the inordinate care they take, every element of the productions is always impressive, the skill of the staff clearly passed onto successive ensembles of actors. There is a level of excellence that screams at you from the stage. Not just in the ingenious interpretations and brilliant performances, honed by the long and creatively stimulating rehearsal process, but also in the costumes, the music, the sets and the choreography.<br />
I imagine for the actors there is something very liberating about having the support of the all that experience.</p>
<p>I often come away from these theatre trips much more aware of the value of what they do as an organisation. It chimes with some of my beliefs about the necessity of taking risks, working at the edge of your comfort zone, working with enthusiasts and most importantly <a title="You gotta believe" href="http://helenwalker.net/2014/07/21/you-gotta-believe/">having fun at work</a>.</p>
<p>I come back inspired to develop skills and endeavour to become masterful in my own field. It also makes me aware that it is the whole that is brilliant rather than any one individual part, that for me delivering brilliant training is about more than an excellent performance, or some great activities, it is about all the elements of a session being focused on the outcomes that you and the participants are trying to achieve. I like that challenge</p>
