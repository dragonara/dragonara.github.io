<p>The words people choose to use are very important.</p>
<p>Sometimes the vocabulary I choose to use seems to make some people uncomfortable. No, not the swearing! Sometimes I use words like 'love', 'passion', 'purpose', authenticity in the context of work; making people flinch or roll their eyes.</p>
<p>The trouble is those are my words, the words that I specifically choose to use. The challenge seems to be that for some people, in their mental model of work, the think that they should perform their jobs as dispassionately as possible. Some of those people talk to me as if those kind of emotions are surplus to requirements or with the suspicion that people's feelings might actually get in the way of them being effective.</p>
<p>I think listening to people's word choices is a good way to understand them better. The beauty of the English language is that there are lots of words to pick from. And actually, I personally think love is a perfectly <a href="http://theenthusiastictrainer.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/love.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-602" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/love.png?w=223" alt="Love" width="223" height="300" /></a>appropriate response to work.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day whether you agree with me or not, that is my choice of word and that choice gives you an insight into how my mind works. I'm not going to change that choice because you find it uncomfortable, but I'm happy to talk about it.</p>
