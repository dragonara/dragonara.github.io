<p>So it's day 2 of our little project and it's my turn to try and inspire the mighty geek after <a title="Wayne's Day 1" href="http://waynehanley.com/blog/2015/07/27/doodle-a-day-day-1/" target="_blank">yesterday's excellent doodle</a>.</p>
<p>So here are my thoughts on happy...</p>

<p>Happy is one of those words, like love, that means a lot of different things. If I'm honest though I don't think being happy is the most meaningful focus. Perhaps the idea of chasing down happiness might just be a red herring, maybe a marketing ploy or a product of too many self-help books.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that I don't hope to be happy, far from it. I just think that moments of happy are delightfully serendipitous. Planning them is like planning an amazing New Year's Eve, prone to disappointment. Â Real moments of happiness, in my experience, are often much more unexpected.</p>
<p>Instead I am working towards a more substantial thing, a kind of contentment that happens when I am aiming towards my sense of purpose, and being playful.</p>
<p>Finding people and projects that allow me to get closer to doing the stuff that brings me closer to that sense of contentment isn't always easy, but then I'm not sure that's a bad thing!</p>
